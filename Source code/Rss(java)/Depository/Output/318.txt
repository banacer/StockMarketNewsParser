Robert Giardina’s interest in fitness took him from a poolside post to
the front office. Giardina said his interest in the fitness world started
at a young age from being around his father who was into weight lifting.
As a teenager, Giardina worked as a lifeguard at a local health club.
Eventually, he started working as a personal trainer at Town Sports
International.

Giardina, of Edison, became chief executive of Town Sports International
in 2002. The company is headquartered in New York and is a leading owner
and operator of fitness clubs.

Town Sports International operates 158 fitness clubs and operates under
the brand names of New York Sports Clubs, Boston Sports Clubs, Washington
Sports Clubs and Philadelphia Sports Clubs.

Giardina spoke to The Star-Ledger about the fitness industry.

Q. How did you work your way up from being a fitness trainer to the CEO?
A. I was a good trainer because customer service was very important to
me. I also held virtually every job in the company, so I learned to do
everything in the business.

Q. How has the current economic climate impacted the fitness industry?
A. During 2008-09, people were looking for ways to limit their
discretionary income and one way they cut costs was to the cancel their
health club memberships. It was tough to see that because we’re talking
about cutting out something that can help improve and maintain good
health.

The people who dropped off in 2008-09 were likely not frequent gym users.
If you were a frequent user, you were likely visiting the gym more during
the downturn.

People joke that our favorite members are the ones who have a membership
that goes unused.

That’s not the case, we love our members and our goal is creating
relationships with them and helping them find success.

Q. What tips would you offer someone looking to climb the ladder in their
workplace?
A. Learn as much about the business as possible and always be nice to
people.
