Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) will introduce Blockbuster’s streaming movie
service next month according to a Bloomberg report. Interestingly, this
move coincides with Netflix&#8217;s (NASDAQ:NFLX) price increases and
comes after Starz’s recent decision to not renew its content deal with
Netflix. Dish Network is likely to keep pricing competitive to attract
some frustrated Netflix customers. However the extent of the impact on
Netflix will be determined by the quality and quantity of content that
Blockbuster can offer through Dish, which is unknown at this point.
Nevertheless a good streaming service from Dish may change the way
subscribers and investors look at the company.



Dish is transforming into a different, and more ambitious, company which
is something that rival DirecTV (NASDAQ:DTV) as well as other pay-TV
companies are closely watching. With plans to introduce a mobile
broadband network and potentially revive Blockbuster, Dish wants to
assert that the company has long-term plans to create value for
shareholders.

We estimate that Blockbuster & equipment sales business constitutes about
10% to Dish Network’s stock, with Blockbuster accounting for most of this.

Our price estimate for Dish Network stands at $29, a premium of about 20%
to the market price.
