This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
statements reflect management's current expectations, as of the date of
this press release, and involve certain risks and uncertainties. The
Company's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.

These factors include, among others, the Company's history of operating
losses and the potential for future losses, which may lead the Company to
not be able to continue as a going concern; the Company's need for
substantial additional financing to meet its business objectives; the
potential for the loss of funding from the Company's R&D grants and
contracts and its ability to win additional funding under such grants and
contracts; the Company's failure to successfully and timely develop new
products; the risks inherent in the early stages of drug development and
in conducting clinical trials; the Company's inability to obtain
regulatory approval in a timely manner or at all; the Company's
collaborative relationships and the financial risks related thereto; the
Company's ability to comply with its obligations under license
agreements; the potential for significant product liability claims; and
the Company's ability to comply with various safety, environmental and
other governmental regulations. Some of these factors could cause future
results to materially differ from the recent results or those projected
in forward-looking statements. See also the "Risk Factors" and
"Forward-Looking Statements" described in the Company's periodic filings
