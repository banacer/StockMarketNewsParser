PRINCETON, N.J., Sept. 6, 2011 /PRNewswire/ — Next Inning Technology
Research (http://www.nextinning.com), an online investment newsletter
focused on semiconductor and technology stocks, has published updated
outlooks for Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC), STMicroelectronics
(NYSE:STM), International Rectifier (NYSE:IRF), Diodes (NASDAQ:DIOD), ON
Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ONNN).

Next Inning editor Paul McWilliams has leveraged a decades-long career as
a semiconductor industry insider to deliver in-depth insights and winning
stock selections for his newsletter subscribers. Ã‚Â McWilliams’ Next
Inning model portfolio has posted huge gains, returning 244% since its
inception in 2002, and he has been picking more potential big winners for
2011.

McWilliams has been right on target this year with his predictions on the
direction of the market. Ã‚Â From the spring sell-off to the June rebound
to the slump in July and massive selloff that followed, McWilliams has
kept Next Inning readers one step ahead of the market.

An example of a recent call for Next Inning trial subscribers: McWilliams
suggested investors buy Finisar ahead of the market open on August 22
when it was trading at only $15.61 and reiterated the call ahead of the
August 29th opening at $17.18. Ã‚Â As McWilliams predicted, Finisar
guided well above Wall Street expectations and the stock surged to open
last Friday in the $20s.

Trial subscribers will receive McWilliams’ highly acclaimed earnings
previews and his quarterly State of Tech series, which offers in-depth,
sector-by-sector coverage of over 65 leading tech companies, as well as
his daily commentary that covers more than 100 of the hottest names in
tech.

McWilliams covers these topics and more in his recent reports:

– What is behind Lattice’s recent price slide? Ã‚Â Does McWilliams have a
positive view of the additions to Lattice’s board of directors? Ã‚Â Might
a new supplier agreement for Huawei suggest positive news for Lattice?

– What three factors have weighed on shares of STMicro of late? Has the
stock fallen too far? Ã‚Â Does McWilliams see the stock trading above $10
when the broader tech sector recovers?

– What sets International Rectifier apart from other companies in the
discrete semiconductor segment? Ã‚Â Does McWilliams have a positive view
of rival Diodes?

– What factors are working against ON Semi right now? Ã‚Â Could one of
these negatives become a positive later this year?

Founded in September 2002, Next Inning’s model portfolio has returned
234% since its inception versus 29% for the S&P 500. Ã‚Â
