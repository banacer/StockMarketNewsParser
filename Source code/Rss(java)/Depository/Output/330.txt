(Source: Datamonitor)Citrix Systems, Inc., a provider of virtual
computing solutions, has announced that the University of Tennessee at
Knoxville has launched Apps@UT, a program implementing Citrix XenDesktop
that runs on a Cisco and NetApp infrastructure to deliver full Windows
desktops and applications as an on-demand service.

Apps@UT will reportedly give University of Tennessee at Knoxville's (UT
Knoxville) more than 27,000 students and staff anytime access to virtual
desktops, applications, personal files and network resources.

UT Knoxville has launched its Citrix virtual computing solutions at the
university's lab, The Commons in Hodges Library, where Apps@UT will serve
the 16,500 users that use The Commons' computers each semester. Apps@UT
will be implemented at all the computer labs managed by UT Knoxville's
Office of Information Technology. Ultimately, the virtual desktops and
applications will be available to 27,000 students and staff on all
university-owned and personal devices.

Students are likely to benefit from enhanced productivity as XenDesktop
transforms any Windows, web or software-as-a-service application into a
service that can be accessed by any user, anytime and anywhere, with
unparalleled simplicity and scalability.

Apps@UT is built on integrated solutions from Citrix, NetApp and Cisco,
providing a flexible infrastructure that is validated and optimized to
work together. The NetApp Unified Storage Architecture enables UT
Knoxville students and staff to store and access their virtual desktop
and user data from all university-owned and personal devices.

Additionally, the high-availability features inherent in the NetApp
platform deliver 24x7 access to desktops and automatically backup student
data. This anytime remote access and data protection is a fundamental
component to any virtual desktop infrastructure and will help students be
more productive and increase overall utilization of the Apps@UT network.
Furthermore, the NetApp architecture provides UT Knoxville with storage
efficiency technologies that will enable the university to more
effectively manage data growth, lower power and cooling requirements, and
reduce overall storage costs.

For the Apps@UT service, the university is building its Citrix XenDesktop
infrastructure on the Cisco Unified Computing System blade server
platform. Cisco UCS offers a compelling mix of performance, scalability
and decreased datacenter footprint, which reinforces the energy-saving
aspect of Apps@UT.

UT Knoxville is also implementing Citrix NetScaler and Branch Repeater
with XenDesktop to optimize the performance of networks, applications and
services. The Citrix suite of virtual computing solutions is expected to
save the university time and resources by enabling easy, centralized
management of desktops and applications. This implementation will also
reduce the cost of software refreshes, security patches, and other
maintenance.

In addition, as older PCs in the university labs are phased out and
replaced by thin clients under the Apps@UT program, the university will
generate energy savings and reduce both the frequency and cost of
hardware refreshes. Citrix Platinum Partner, LPS Integration, is also
assisting UT Knoxville with the rollout of Citrix virtualization
solutions.
