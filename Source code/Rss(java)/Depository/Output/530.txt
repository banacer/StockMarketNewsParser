(RTTNews) - Office of Fair Trade Tuesday said it has cleared the
anticipated merger between Level 3 Communications Inc. (LVLT: News ) and
Global Crossing Ltd. (GLBC: News ).

Level 3 Communications is a US company which offers a range of
communications services. Within Europe these are predominately at the
wholesale level related to its infrastructure. Its fibre optic network
covers North America and Europe.

Global Crossing Limited is a Bermuda registered company which offers a
range of communications services.

On April 10, 2011 the parties signed an Amalgamation Agreement, under
which Global Crossing will amalgamate with a wholly owned subsidiary of
Level 3, Apollo Amalgamation Sub Ltd., with the amalgamated company being
renamed Level 3 GC Limited. Global Crossing shareholders will receive 16
shares of Level 3 common stock for each share that they own in Global
Crossing. At the time of the agreement this valued the deal at US$3
billion.
