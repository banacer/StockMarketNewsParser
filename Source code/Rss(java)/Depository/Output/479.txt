China Sunergy amends module product warranty policy



On September 2nd, 2011, China Sunergy Co. Ltd. (Nanjing, China) announced
that it decided to make amendment in module product warranty policy.

Under the new policy, the company will extend its limited product
warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship 10 years from five
years for all standard Photovoltaic Solar Module products shipped after
August 10th, 2011.

In addition, China Sunergy is offering a limited power warranty for
repair or replacement at the 12, 20, and 25 year marks, relating to any
modules who deliver less than 90%, 83%, and 80%, respectively, of
promised minimum power output.

"We are proud to offer our customers these new warranty terms, which
demonstrate China Sunergy's commitment to our customers' long-term
success and our faith in our products' excellent performance. China
Sunergy is known above all else for our product quality and
industry-leading technology, and the reputation of our CSUN module brand
as one of the best in the industry is growing. The new policy will enable
us to offer added value to the industry and will strengthen CSUN's sales
and marketing potential," China Sunergy CEO Stephen Cai said.
