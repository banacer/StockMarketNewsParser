Acme Packet Names Seamus Hourihan Senior Vice President of Corporate
Strategy and Appoints Marianne Budnik Chief Marketing Officer














BEDFORD, Mass., Sep 06, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Acme Packet(R) , the
leader in session delivery networks, today announced that Seamus Hourihan
has been named Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy. Concurrently,
Marianne Budnik has been appointed Chief Marketing Officer (CMO).

Hourihan's appointment as Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy
bolsters Acme Packet's ability to capitalize on the social, business and
technology trends driving growth in next-generation session-oriented
voice, video, data and unified communications. In his new position, he
will lead the company's strategic planning process, evaluating new
markets and opportunities to expand the company's business.













Hourihan has served as the company's Senior Vice President of Product
Management and Marketing since 2001. He first coined the term "session
border control" and has driven industry recognition of the critical
importance of the new product category created by Acme Packet. Hourihan
has also been responsible for expanding Acme Packet's vision into the
concept of "session delivery networks." Acme Packet's session delivery
network solutions now encompass eight different product categories for
delivering trusted, first-class voice, video, data and unified
communications.

In her new role, Budnik is responsible for Acme Packet's overall
marketing strategy and integrated market initiatives including
communications, corporate marketing, field marketing and product
marketing activities. She will also oversee the company's product line
management organization. An accomplished 20-year marketing veteran, she
brings to Acme Packet substantial executive-level experience earned while
defining and driving innovative, revenue-enhancing corporate, product,
field and channel marketing programs for two of the world's most visible
technology companies.

Budnik joins Acme Packet from CA Technologies , where since 2009 she has
served as CMO for the multibillion dollar provider of IT management
software and solutions. Prior to joining CA Technologies, she held a
series of leadership positions within EMC Corporation , spanning global
field marketing, operations and strategic planning, and product
marketing. She holds an MBA from Boston University and earned a
bachelor's degree from Babson College.

"There has never been a more exciting time to be in our industry, as the
integration of voice, video and data over IP networks redefines the way
we communicate," said Acme Packet President and CEO Andy Ory. "We are at
a point in the company's growth where it is critical to have a seasoned
executive like Seamus fully focused on corporate strategy, and I look
forward to working closely with him as we capitalize on the rapidly
expanding, global opportunity for session delivery networks. We're also
pleased to welcome Marianne to our team. She brings a keen understanding
of the role that marketing plays, paired with a proven track record for
implementing creative, result-driven initiatives on a global basis."
