Solar energy projects in Ontario receive $455mn loan guarantees





Sep 6, 2011





First Solar Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR) received $455.7 million in loan
guarantees from the Export-Import Bank of the United States for two solar
power projects in Ontario.

The bank will guarantee a loan worth $236.7 million for a 50 MW plant to
be built in the townships of Amherstburg, Belmont and Walpole. Another
guarantee for a $219 million loan was also approved for a 40 MW solar
farm in St. Clair.

The bank will secure First Solar commercial loans in case of a default.
The debt will help finance project components First Solar will export to
Ontario to build the projects and is to be repaid over 18 years.

Vancouver-based Plutonic Power and General Energy Financial Services will
own the 50 MW project. NextEra Energy Resources will own the 40 MW
facility. Both projects are expected to sell power to the Ontario Power
Authority under a 20-year power purchase agreement.
