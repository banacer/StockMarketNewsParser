Sep 06, 2011 (SmarTrend(R) News Watch via COMTEX) -- Below are the top
five companies in the Computer Hardware industry as measured by their
Debt to EBITDA ratio.

The measure of a debt's pay-back period is Debt/EBITDA. The longer the
payback period, the greater the risk. This metric ignores all tax
expenses even though a good portion are cash payments and gets paid first.

Diebold (NYSE:DBD - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.44x
based on total debt of $688.6 million.

Avid Technology (NASDAQ:AVID - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio
of 2.01x based on total debt of $31.8 million.

Dell (NASDAQ:DELL - Analyst Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.42x
based on total debt of $7.7 billion.

Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ - Analyst Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio of
1.4x based on total debt of $25.7 billion.

Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA
ratio of 0.44x based on total debt of $28.2 million.

SmarTrend currently has shares of Hewlett-Packard in an Downtrend and
issued the Downtrend alert on February 23, 2011 at $43.15. The stock has
fallen 43.6% since the Downtrend alert was issued.
