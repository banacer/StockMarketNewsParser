Before the US market opened Tuesday, few companies reported their
quarterly earnings, while several companies are scheduled to unveil their
financial results after the market closes. Some notable earners are
discussed here.

Pike Electric Corp. (NYSE: PIKE), one of the US's leading energy
solutions providers, reported its fiscal 2011 fourth quarter earnings
today. During the quarter, the company's revenue totaledÂ $162.7
million, an increase of 35 percent compared toÂ $120.7 millionÂ in
the year-ago period. Its registered net income of $2.1 million, 6 cents
per diluted share during the period, compared to a net loss of $4
million, or 12 cents per diluted share, a year earlier. Analysts had
estimated a net profit of 4 cents per share for the company. Core
services revenue totaledÂ $122.0 millionÂ in the fiscal fourth
quarter 2011, compared toÂ $116.9 millionÂ in the year-ago period.
Storm restoration revenue totaledÂ $40.7 million, the highest level
since the fiscal third quarter 2009. Discussing the company's financial
performance, Chairman and CEO J. Eric Pike said, "We continued to build
momentum throughout the year, culminating in this quarter's strong
performance. The deliberate actions taken last year to restructure the
Company lowered our cost structure, plus we experienced continued growth
in our core services revenue and an increased volume of storm restoration
activity."

Mobile Telesystems OJSC (NYSE: MBT), a leading telecommunication provider
in Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, announced it's un-audited US
GAAP results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011. During the
quarter, the company reported net profit of $367 million, up from
previous year's net profit of $357.7 million but below analysts' estimate
of $392 million. The company's consolidated revenues up 6.6 percent
quarter-over-quarter toÂ $3.128 billion, below analysts forecast of
$3.15 billion. CEO Andrei Dubovskov said, "Group revenue for the quarter
increased 13 percent year-over-year to reachÂ $3.128 billion. During
the quarter we have delivered healthy revenue growth on the back of the
seasonally strong mobile business performance and growing contributions
from our retail and fixed business. Total revenues inÂ RussiaÂ -
including mobile, fixed and handset and equipment sales - have increased
year-over-year by 9 percent to 76.1 billion rubles. Our mobile business
demonstrated 10 percent year-over-year growth up to 63.1 billion rubles
on the back on of higher voice and data usage; strong net subscriber
additions coupled with a sequential decline in churn; rising sales of
handsets and active sales of modems and data tariff plans as demand
continues to grow for data as we expand our 3G networks." Â 

Verifone Systems, Inc. (NYSE: PAY), a global leader in secure electronic
payment technologies, will announce its FY2011 Q3 earnings later today.
