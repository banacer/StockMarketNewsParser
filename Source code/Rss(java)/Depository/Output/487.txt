Calling Students Who Want to Change the World: Nation's Premier
Sustainability Competition Starts Now



-- Siemens Foundation and Discovery Education Launch Fourth Annual
Siemens We Can Change the World Challenge -- -- High School Students are
Now Invited to Tackle Any Environmental Issue of Their Choice --
















ISELIN, N.J., Sept. 6, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Responsibility for
tomorrow's most daunting environmental problems will fall to the youth of
today - the very people creating some of the most inspired solutions.
Helping generate these solutions is the premier national sustainability
challenge for K-12 students, the Siemens We Can Change the World
Challenge, which today kicks off its 2012 edition. Students team up with
classmates under teacher/mentors to solve environmental problems in their
school (grades K-5), community (grades 6-8) and world (grades 9-12).







Now entering its fourth year, the challenge is a collaborative effort of
the Siemens Foundation, Discovery Education, the National Science
Teachers Association (NSTA), and the College Board. Students at all
levels use scientific investigation and Web-based curriculum tools
powered by Discovery Education to create a replicable green solution.

"Students have a unique ability to look at entrenched environmental
problems with fresh eyes and creative, energized minds," said Jeniffer
Harper-Taylor, president of the Siemens Foundation. "Our goal is to
educate, engage and empower them as they analyze these problems,
brainstorm solutions, and put their hypotheses to the test. Students have
come up with some incredibly impactful ideas over the past three years,
many of which have been implemented by schools, communities and
organizations. I look forward to seeing what this year's challenge
brings."

Nearly 18,000 elementary, middle and high school students competed in
last year's challenge, offering innovations in areas such as
food-waste-to-energy, community-scale battery recycling, phantom-power
load reduction, systematic behavior change, erosion control, wildlife
habitat restoration and sustainable agriculture for arid zones. Last
year's Grand Prize winners came from schools all across the country,
including:

West Branch High School, West Branch, Iowa, conducted an energy audit of
their high school and found many items that could be improved

Kohala Middle School, Kapaau, Hawaii, collected over 66,000 batteries in
the community for proper disposal

Barringer Academic Center, Charlotte, N.C., completed a campaign that
reduced paper waste in their school

Concord Hill School, Chevy Chase, Md., reduced car idling by parents at
their school by 70 percent

Now it's your turn

To join this educational initiative toward improving the planet's
outlook, teachers and mentors can register for the Siemens We Can Change
the World Challenge, add their student teams and begin formulating their
projects at www.wecanchange.com . Student and teacher/mentor prizes,
which vary according to grade level and value more than $250,000 total,
include scholarships, savings bonds, school grants, adventure trips and a
chance to present their idea at the United Nations.

A panel of environmental experts and science educators will judge teams
based on their research, analysis and the ability of the solution to be
replicated on a larger scale. High school students are specifically
challenged to address: energy, biodiversity, land management, water
conservation and cleanup, or air and climate.

The www.wecanchange.com site will help teams get started, offering a
robust resource section that includes lesson plans, e-books, virtual labs
and more to accompany each stage of the challenge. These materials are
created by Discovery Education, a division of Discovery Communications
that provides scientifically proven standards-based digital content and
resources to classrooms nationwide.

The deadline for all entries is March 15, 2012. Finalists will be
announced in April 2012 and the national winners will be announced in May
2012. For more information on the Siemens We Can Change the World
Challenge, visit www.wecanchange.com or www.facebook.com/wecanchange .

Foundation, Discovery Education, the College Board and the National
Science Teachers Association (NSTA) to educate, empower and engage
