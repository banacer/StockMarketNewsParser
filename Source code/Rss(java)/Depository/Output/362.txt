HONG KONG -- Asia Entertainment & Resources Ltd. (&#x201C;AERL&#x201D;)
(NASDAQ: AERL), which operates through its subsidiaries and related
promoter companies as a VIP room gaming promoter, today announced
unaudited Rolling Chip Turnover (as defined below) for the month of
August 2011 at the company&#x2019;s VIP rooms in Macau was US$1.822
billion, up 112% year-over-year compared to US$858 million for the month
of August 2010.

This compares with a year-over-year increase in gross gaming revenue for
Macau of 57% for August 2011. For the first eight months of 2011,
AERL&#x2019;s Rolling Chip Turnover was US$12.441 billion (an average of
$1.517 billion per month), up 105% year-over-year, compared to US$6.070
billion for the first eight months of 2010. Macau gross gaming revenue
increased 47% for the first eight months of 2011.

The exceptional growth in Rolling Chip Turnover was attributable to
organic growth, increasing cage capital from the increased line of credit
provided by Galaxy Macau and the Venetian Macao-Resort-Hotel allowing for
higher levels of Rolling Chip Turnover, the completion of the acquisition
of 100% of the profit interest in the operations of King&#x2019;s Gaming
Promotion Limited (&#x201C;KGP&#x201D;), thereby adding to AERL a VIP
room at the Venetian Macao-Resort-Hotel in Cotai and the recent opening
of a VIP room at the new Galaxy Macau&#x2122; in Cotai.



The Company&#x2019;s VIP rooms are primarily focused on high stakes
baccarat. Baccarat accounts for approximately 88% of total Macau casino
winnings according to the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau
(DICJ). In Macau, two remuneration methods are used to compensate VIP
room gaming promoters. On a fixed commission basis, VIP room gaming
promoter revenues are based on an agreed percentage of Rolling Chip
Turnover. On a win/loss split basis, the VIP room gaming promoter
receives an agreed percentage of the &#x201C;win&#x201D; in the VIP
gaming room (plus certain incentive allowances), and is required to also
bear the same percentage of losses that might be incurred. Compared to
the fixed commission basis, the win/loss split basis subjects the VIP
room gaming promoter to the risk of losses from the gaming
patron&#x2019;s activity and greater volatility.

AERL&#x2019;s VIP rooms at the Galaxy Star World in Downtown Macau,
Venetian Macao-Resort-Hotel and Galaxy Macau&#x2122; in Cotai are based
on a fixed commission. Because all of AERL&#x2019;s revenues are now
directly related to Rolling Chip Turnover, the Company is concentrating
its marketing efforts to increase the number of patrons and the amount of
play at its VIP gaming rooms. Consequently, in order to increase the
Rolling Chip Turnover, the Company reinvests its earnings to increase the
amount of cage capital available to finance the increased patron activity.
