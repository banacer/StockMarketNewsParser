Study Island Growing Its Presence as California Schools Incorporate
Digital Education Into the Classroom

DALLAS, Sept. 6, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Facing crippling budget cuts
and ever-increasing demands for student performance, California schools
are finding creative ways to do more with less. One solution, according
to more than 1,200 schools across the state, is the Study Island
web-based, high impact, low cost standards mastery solution from
Archipelago Learning (Nasdaq:ARCL), a leading subscription-based,
software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider of education products.

This year alone schools from Los Angeles, West Covina, Torrance, Upland
and Rialto Unified School Districts, among others, have purchased Study
Island or expanded their existing implementations to help address
learning gaps and differentiate instruction for improved student outcomes.

"These contracts are clear evidence that Study Island is filling a
growing need for flexible, cost-effective, all-digital supplemental
education solutions that help improve the performance of students and
teachers. Schools quickly realize a return on their investment through
student engagement and performance in the classroom," said Tim McEwen,
chairman, chief executive officer and president of Archipelago Learning.

Baldwin Park Unified School District (USD), located in the central San
Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles County, started using various Study
Island programs in its elementary schools to provide standards-based
instruction, practice and assessment for students in math and reading.
The district then expanded its use and offered selected Study Island
programs to the middle/junior high schools and the high schools. To
accelerate learning, many Baldwin Park schools encourage students to use
the web-based educational programs outside the school day, and make Study
Island available to students participating in programs before school and
after school. In addition, several schools use Study Island's parent
notification system to simplify communication between teachers and
parents.

"Study Island is a cost-effective solution that can be used in a variety
of ways," said Arturo Ortega, assistant superintendent of Baldwin Park
USD. "Our subscription allows schools the flexibility to utilize it in
the way that works best for them. One school may choose to use it only in
the computer lab during regularly scheduled classes, while another may
use it in the lab, before and after school, during recess and lunch, in
the library, and in individual classrooms. We can maximize our usage of
Study Island as much as we want and, for the price, we get a lot out of
it. Plus, new capabilities and enhancements are always being introduced
that make the product better and better."

Fern Elementary School in Torrance also uses Study Island. Its principal,
Valerie Williams, is very satisfied with the program and opted to renew
their contract. "We use Study Island as an intervention only program, and
because of its effectiveness in motivating students, will continue to use
it," said Williams. "One of Study Island's benefits is its ability to
allow students to study individually in standard test format or
interactive game mode by providing engaging, self-paced instruction and
positive reinforcement. Study Island also creates an atmosphere of
healthy competition which motivates the students to study."

The award-winning Study Island system is a single, integrated product
that can save schools thousands of dollars annually by eliminating the
need to purchase disparate systems for instruction, assessment, planning,
and communication. With supplemental lessons and activities built
directly from the California Content Standards and the Common Core State
Standards, Study Island helps K-12 students master grade-level content
and improve their performance on state tests. The online solution also
includes customized assessments, engaging games, digital writing
portfolios, college and career readiness tools, real-time reporting,
productivity tools, a parent notification system, and an extensive
professional development module with online video tutorials, lesson
plans, and interactive whiteboard resources.
