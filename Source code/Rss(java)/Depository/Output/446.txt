J.P. Morgan is upgrading SodaStream International (NASDAQ:SODA) to
Overweight from Neutral with a $50 price target (prev. NA).

With the company reporting roughly in-line Q211 earnings and
disappointing full year guidance, the stock has taken a major hit,
dropping about 48% while the S&P has been up nearly 5% over that same
time frame. While the stock has obviously lost momentum, they continue to
believe that the short to medium term growth potential for SODA is strong
and that their 2H guidance will prove to be too conservative. With the
multiple having compressed from roughly 40x down to about 19x, 17x
ex-cash, and with guidance that seems overly conservative, the firm
thinks the stock is attractive here.

The details:

Growth is still there despite the conservative guidance. Even though SODA
simply reiterated their FY11 guidance, which alarmed a number of
investors, we continue to believe that SODA is a growth story. We believe
the company's 2H11 guidance is far too conservative as the company
implied top line growth of nearly 31% for Q311, but only 10% growth YOY
in Q4. Even though SODA faces a tough +59% comp in Q411, we note that
their total US door count at this point (assuming no move into mass) has
grown by +86%. In the end, we think that SODA's guidance will prove to be
too conservative and we expect the test in mass (and a potential full
roll-out) to provide upside to Q4 numbers. We are currently forecasting
16% revenue growth for Q4, but think our estimate could be too low.

At 19x our FY12 estimate, 17x after adjusting for cash, the stock is too
cheap. With the stock down more than 50% from its high, we believe that
stock is clearly much more attractive, especially as we believe there are
no material changes to the story. With the rest of our group having
re-rated positively since the market's turn, SODA is just trading at a
slight premium to the group.

US door growth is high, and trends continue to be strong at BBBY. We
expect US doors to be up almost 100% yoy in Q4, and while the comps get
more difficult, we still expect strong growth. Over the past few weeks we
have contacted a number of Bed, Bath, and Beyond locations (BBBY
locations are about 13% of US doors) to get an update on SodaStream
products. Overall, it appears that machine and flavor sales, along with
C02 refills continue to be strong, which is very encouraging.

We rate SODA OW. While the LT growth profile is less than the bulls would
like to think, the ST results should be better than expected.
Establishing a $50 price target for December 2012 based on 21x our 2013
estimate. As management discusses the conservatism baked into their Q4
guidance, we expect the multiple to move up

Notablecalls: SODA was a $80 stock back in the beginning of August. The
recent high-flyer got smashed after management failed to raise guidance
on its most recent conference call.

So now it's at $35 trading 19x EPS while growing EPS by 30%+. We saw a
couple of tier-2 firms pound the table to bits on the way down, with
little success.

Now we have a tier-1 firm out saying SODA is not a broken story and that
things are going pretty well for them. JPM actually highlights some
checks they made and these came back positive.

That carries some more weight. A lot more weight actually. Short interest
stands at over 70%. The valuation is bound to adjust at some point.

One to watch. If this one gets going, the shorts will have one hell of a
task keeping it down here.

Tape's drek but the lower we open the better chances we have for an
outsized bounce in my humble opinion.
