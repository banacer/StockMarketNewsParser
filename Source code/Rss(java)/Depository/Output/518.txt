NEW YORK, NEW YORK, Sep 06, 2011 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) -- BMO Capital
Markets, the investment and corporate banking arm of BMO Financial Group
, today announced a number of hires to expand and enhance the firm's
coverage of financial institutions.

"We are pleased to increase our coverage of financial clients across the
U.S. We are hiring experts in insurance and financial services broadly
and are adding M&A-focused resources in order to bring all of BMO's
products and expertise to this essential sector," said Perry Hoffmeister,
Head of U.S. Investment & Corporate Banking, BMO Capital Markets.

To this end, James MacNaughton, a 30-year investment banking veteran, has
joined the firm as Vice Chair of U.S. Investment and Corporate Banking.
The New York-based Financial Institutions Group (FIG) is also being
expanded to include a sector focused on Insurance; this sector will be
led by Scott Littlejohn, who has joined as Managing Director & Head of
U.S. Insurance Investment Banking. Also joining the firm in the Insurance
sector is Phil Enan, who has been appointed Vice President. Ariel Walsh,
a BMO veteran, is also relocating to New York to focus exclusively on FIG
M&A across North America.

"Jim has a tremendous depth of capital markets and M&A experience in the
financial institutions sector in insurance, banks, diversified
financials, securities firms, asset management and securities exchanges,"
said Mr. Hoffmeister. "Given his extensive background with Financial
Institutions, Jim will mostly be working with clients in this industry;
but all of us will be able to draw on his experience, leadership and
extensive relationships.

"The U.S. insurance industry represents a new sector for us with great
potential. Scott Littlejohn's intimate knowledge of the industry, and his
almost 20 years of experience in bringing investment and corporate
banking services to the insurance sector, make him the ideal person to
run this business," added Mr. Hoffmeister. "We believe that our focus on
bringing universal banking services to underserved mid-cap insurance
companies will be well received by clients. We look forward to providing
world class service to these clients."

Mr. MacNaughton, Mr. Littlejohn and Mr. Walsh will be working closely
with Erik Van Nispen, head of BMO's U.S. Financial Institutions Group as
well as with BMO's Canadian FIG team, led by Brad Hardie. BMO's new U.S.
insurance practice will complement the Firm's existing areas of focus,
including Market Structure, Specialty Finance, Financial Technology and
Asset Management.
