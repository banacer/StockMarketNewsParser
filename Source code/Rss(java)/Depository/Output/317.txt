What’s the best place to watch a football game on TV in Washtenaw County?
The voters in AnnArbor.com’s BestOf contest say it’s the Buffalo Wild
Wings (Ypsilanti) which won 1st place, garnering 106 votes.

Best place to watch a football game on TV voting began last Sunday and
ended at 11:59 p.m. Saturday.





Fraser’s Pub held first place for much of the week while Buffalo Wild
Wings (Ypsilanti) and The Arena Sports Bar were steadily within the top
3. Toward the end of the week, the tides turned and The Arena Sports Bar
and Buffalo Wild Wings (Ypsilanti) pulled ahead of Fraser’s and
alternated between first and second place. In the end, Buffalo Wild Wings
(Ypsilanti) took first place, The Arena Sports Bar placed in second while
Fraser’s Pub finished in third.

This week vote in two contests: Best place for auto service (full
service, non-dealership) and Best auto dealership (sales and service).

What’s that weird clunking noise I hear every time I turn left? Why can’t
I make my van go? Your trusty mechanic is standing by to help you answer
these and many other questions.

And when the answer is that that van will no longer go, your dealership’s
sales department can expertly match you with the next car of your dreams.

What's your favorite dealership and your favorite place for auto service?
Cast your vote. Service and Dealership.

Readers also can suggest contenders for upcoming contests.

And don't forget, everyone who votes will be entered into a drawing each
week for a chance to win a prize. This week's prize is for a $50 gift
card.
