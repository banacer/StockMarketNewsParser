 A new poll commissioned by the American Meat Institute (AMI) and
conducted by Harris Interactive found that only 19 percent of U.S. adults
who cook hamburgers or poultry (chicken or turkey) burgers use an
instant-read thermometer to test internal temperature. Approximately 73
percent of adults who cook hamburgers or poultry burgers rely on sight to
determine doneness, and 57 percent rely on cooking time.

Other findings are:

* Instant-read thermometers are used by only 13%t of adults aged 18-34,
  many of whom may prepare food for small children at home, 
* 78% of this age group rely on sight, which is not an accurate
  indicator of doneness.
* Only 20% of U.S. adults know  a hamburger should be cooked to 160
  degree F to ensure it is safe to consume; 41% mistakenly believe that
  safe temperatures are less than 160 degrees F. 
* Only 13 percent know that a poultry burger should be cooked to 165
  degree F; 47% believe that lower is safe

“Meat and poultry companies use many food safety strategies to make our
products as safe as we can, and it is our responsibility to empower our
customers with the information that they need to ensure that the products
are safe when served,” said AMI Senior Vice President of Public Affairs
Janet Riley. “Our poll reveals that a significant knowledge gap still
exists about proper cooking temperatures and thermometer use. U.S. meat
and poultry products are among the safest in the world, but like all raw
agricultural products, they can contain bacteria, and that is why it is
important to take time to remind consumers about safe handling and
cooking practices.”
