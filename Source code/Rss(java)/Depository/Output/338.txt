Google App Engine Price Rises Shock Developers

In May, Google announced that it would alter the price of its cloud
computing service App Engine, the company's Platform as a Service
offering, later in the year, presumably in an effort to turn the product
into another profit centre for the company. Google has now announced that
the price changes will occur in the second half of September, at the same
time as the product officially loses its "preview" tag. Google has
provided a tool that lets existing users calculate how much they'll pay
under the new service.

Whilst Google said it expects most currently active apps to full under
the free quota, the majority of paying customers will see their prices
rise. In return customers should see a better service, with Google
introducing an SLA for paid customers and an SLA with operational support
for premium.

The reaction of Google's customer base on the official App Engine group
has been largely negative. A before-and-after App Engine price comparison
thread in Google Groups sees developers reporting increases of 50%, 100%,
or much more. A separate thread has been started for developers who will
be forced to leave App Engine due to the increased rates.

Elsewhere, Nokia researcher and App Engine user Russell Beattie complains
that under the new pricing model, the cost of his App Engine app for one
day will rise from $2.63 to $34.38 - a figure that will double in
November after a 50% discount expires.

Developer Ugorji Nwoke blogged
Google has done a major disservice to its cult of developers by changing
the pricing terms of App Engine ridiculously while giving developers
short notice to react. In doing so, Google may have done severe damage to
their brand and the trust that developers put in them.

Head of Groovy Development for VMware's SpringSource division, Guillaume
Laforge, wrote
The big problem is the cost of the "frontend instance hours". An app
running all the time, with low traffic, but enough to keep a frontend
instance running all day will cost you 30 bucks a month with this new
pricing policy.

Whilst the majority of developers considering a move to an alternative
service will look at another cloud service such as Amazon's EC2 or
VMware's own Cloud Foundry, it is interesting to compare this with a
conventional Java hosting provider. For an equivalent $29.00/month, for
example, Kattare will provide you with a dedicated Apache Tomcat JVM on a
shared server with a heap size of 256MB and up to 50GB of transfer/month,
fully supported. Of course the Kattare service doesn't include Google's
unique APIs and infrastructure, but that has always been a cause of some
concern for developers using the service. As one user writes on the
official Google mailing list

What has always been the biggest concern about App Engine? Lock-in.
You're at the mercy of Google. Sure there's TyphoonAE etc... but really
those are not alternatives.

What does Google go ahead and do? They do exactly what their critics said
they would do and what us GAE adopters hoped like hell they would never
do, screw us over.

App Engine is finished not because we're all going to move off to EC2,
but because people who are considering using App Engine will see exactly
what has gone on here with the pricing, think about the lock-in argument
against GAE, and decide not to use GAE. There will be a drop off in new
apps, and eventually Google is going to see GAE isn't really panning out
and pull the 3 year plug.

Google hasn't so far responded to the outcry, although on the App Engine
web site the company does say it is looking into special programs for
non-profits, educational institutions, and open-source projects.

   Other options exist


   by Sacha Labourey




   GAE was one of the first PaaS (with salesforce.com) to provide a
   "SaaS-like" model where developers do not have to worry about
   operating system, AS, scalability/hardware, IT, DEVOPS, etc.
   Consequently, comparing GAE to a pure hosting offering is not fair: in
   a pure hosting solution, you end up managing a lot of those concerns,
   adding to the overall cost - probably much more so than the recent GAE
   cost upgrade.

   Now, if your solution isn't compatible anymore with GAE's new pricing
   scheme, alternatives exist, see <a rel="nofollow"
   href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-paasshootout/?ca=
   drs-">this PaaS shoutout for example</a>.

   Cheers,

   Sacha

   disclaimer: I work for one of the vendors in the shoutout: <a
   rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cloudbees.com/">CloudBees</a> - we
   provide a for-pay and GA offering (as well as free trial accounts as
   well obviously).

   GAE free service


   by Rusty Wright




   The GAE free server was meant for developing and debugging your app,
   not for running apps for free. What other cloud service provides free
   servers where you don't pay anything in order to test and deploy your
   app on their cloud servers?
