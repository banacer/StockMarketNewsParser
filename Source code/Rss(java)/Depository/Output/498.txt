Ricoh and EFI Deliver Color Quality, Ease of Use and Greater Automation
to Range of Digital Print Users














FOSTER CITY, Calif., Sep 6, 2011 (GlobeNewswire via COMTEX) -- EFI(TM) ,
a world leader in customer-focused digital printing innovation, today
announced availability of the Fiery(R) E-41A server for the Ricoh(R) Pro
C651EX/C751EX/C751 color production system, bringing superior color
quality, ease of use, and automation of finishing features to quick
print, commercial print and in-plant providers.

"As one of the key servers for our new Pro line-up, Fiery technology is
clearly the best in class in color, ease of use, and reliability," said
Tim Vellek, vice president, Production Printing Business Group at Ricoh
Americas Corporation. "Our customers can now exceed color quality
expectations while saving time and costs when printing documents of all
types."

"With this release, EFI brings customers advanced color management
technology to ensure consistent and accurate color, software enhancements
that improve usability, and full support of finishing devices to automate
the production of complex documents," said John Henze, vice president of
Fiery marketing, EFI. "Together with the powerful features of the new
Ricoh Pro line-up, customers with varying degrees of digital print
experience can take advantage of Fiery technology to produce eye-catching
documents with ease."

The Fiery E-41A server delivers high-quality color out-of-the-box and
provides users the tools to control and manage color throughout the
workflow. Available in the latest version of Command WorkStation(R) user
interface is the new Fiery Image Enhance Visual Editor (IEVE) which
allows editing each image in a job without going back to the native
design file, saving time and reducing costs. IEVE simplifies the editing
process, providing an interactive toolset for optimizing image appearance
and applying automatic per-image corrections, to ensure photos look their
best.

The intuitive and interactive Fiery Command WorkStation(R) user interface
increases productivity and reduces errors and waste by centralizing job
production and management for Windows(R) or Mac environments. Customers
can prepare complex production documents easily with the powerful
composition and imposition tools in the optional Fiery SeeQuence Suite
software.

With the Fiery E-41A server, customers can meet their tight turnaround
times and process more work by automating time consuming manual tasks.
The Fiery-driven Ricoh Pro line-up is ideal for producing manuals
requiring multiple media types in one set, imposed elements in brochures,
folded newsletters, finished booklets, personalized postcards, direct
mail and more, quickly and easily.

Fiery servers connect and integrate with any print environment through
Fiery JDF technology to ensure that job information flows through the
system faster and more efficiently, eliminating waste and rework. The
Fiery E-41A server also includes Adobe(R) PDF Print Engine support, so
users can now choose a native PDF end-to-end workflow, in conjunction
with the conventional PostScript interpreter to ensure accuracy and
consistency of output from design to print.
