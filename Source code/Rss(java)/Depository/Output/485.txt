In a fresh sign of the pessimism surrounding Research in Motion (RIMM), a
major shareholder on Tuesday called for the BlackBerry maker to explore
its strategic options, including a possible sale of the Canadian company.

The disgruntled shareholder, Jaguar Financial, urged RIM executives to
investigate the benefits of a sale, a spinoff or an auction of the
companyÃ¢Â€Â™s lucrative patents. 

RIMÃ¢Â€Â™s stock price has tumbled Ã¢Â€Â“ 50% this year alone Ã¢Â€Â“ due
to BlackBerryÃ¢Â€Â™s shrinking slice in the smartphone market it
essentially created.

According to a Nielsen report from earlier this year, BlackBerry holds
just 23% of the market, compared with 36% for GoogleÃ¢Â€Â™s (GOOG)
Android and 26% for Apple (AAPL).

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe status quo is not acceptable, the company cannot sit
still,Ã¢Â€Â Jaguar CEO Vic Alboini said in a statement. Ã¢Â€ÂœIt is time
for transformational change. The directors need to seize the reins to
maximize shareholder value before more market value is lost."

Specifically, Jaguar called on RIM to create a special committee of four
or five directors to pursue a Ã¢Â€Âœshareholder value maximization
process.Ã¢Â€Â

Jaguar cited RIMÃ¢Â€Â™s share price plunge from nearly $150 in June 2008
to below $30 today, a lack of innovation that caused the market share
decline and worries about the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s dual CEO structure.

In the past, a number of companies have been listed as possible RIM
suitors, including Samsung, HTC, LG, Dell (DELL), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ)
and Microsoft (MSFT).

One option Jaguar advocated for is exploring a sale of the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s
patents, a move that would follow in the footsteps of recent patent
auctions.

Ã¢Â€ÂœRIM is positioned to benefit from the increased appetite for
intellectual property, but the board must change course and recognize the
opportunity,Ã¢Â€Â Jaguar wrote.

It's not clear how large Jaguar's stake in RIM is, and the call from
Jaguar did little to halt the selloff in RIMÃ¢Â€Â™s stock, which dropped
another 3.02% to $30.12 in TuesdayÃ¢Â€Â™s premarkets, compared with a
1.86% fall for the Nasdaq 100.
