Wall Street pointing loses as investors return after a long weekend


9/6/2011 8:57:16 AM



Wall Street is expected to begin with losses as US stock futures were
trading lower owing to disappointing US job data for the month of August,
announced last week amid growing economic turmoil in Europe.



At last check, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 161
points to 11047. Those on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down by 18
points to 1151.25 even as Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 24.25 points to
2140.50.

Meanwhile, the Swiss Franc has nosedived against all major currencies of
the world, as the Swiss National bank announced on Tuesday that it will
very soon take extraordinary steps to stop the surge of Swiss Franc
against Euro. The bank is very likely to peg the franc against the euro.

While the US markets were closed yesterday due to labor day, markets in
Europe were hammered as concerns over sovereign debts defaults aggravated
on Monday amid German Chancellor Angela MerkelÃ¢Â€Â™sÃ‚Â  Christian
Democratic Union losing elections in her home state, pointing Germans are
against financial aid package for struggling Euro zone countries like
Greece. On Monday, Stoxx 600 index plunged by 4.1%. Earlier today,
markets in Europe were signaling a recovery with FTSE, Stoxx 600 and DAC
all gaining, but later shed their gains.

Amid rising market volatility and fears of recession, investors are
betting on gold as shares slide along with the price of oil. December
futures for gold surged by $18.60 to $1,895.70 an ounce, while October
oil futures dropped $1.58 to $84.84 a barrel.

On the economic news front, investors should look out for the data
release from Institute for Supply Management, showing activities in the
US service sector. Analysts expect a slowdown but no outright contraction
in non manufacturing activities.

In corporate news, Walgreen Co. (NYSE: WAG) and Fastenal Co. (NASDAQ:
FAST) are expected to release August sales numbers.

First Horizon National Corporation (NYSE: FHN) shares are also expected
to remain in focus in trading today.
