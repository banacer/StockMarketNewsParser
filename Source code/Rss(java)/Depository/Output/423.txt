New York, September 6th (TradersHuddle.com) Ã¢Â€Â“ Stock futures were
pointing to a lower open as Wall Street return from a long holiday
weekend and gets to react to the turmoil in the Europe, in which stocks
tumbled sharply yesterday on signs the debt crisis in the region is
worsening. Stocks retreated last week triggered mostly by a dismal jobs
report that showed zero job growth in the U.S. for the month of August.

Ã‚Â 

In Asia, stocks fell sharply, with Japan closing at a 2Ã‚Â½ year low, on
fears the euro zone debt crisis in worsening amid economic jitters that
the world economy could slip back into recession as the U.S. economy
struggles to recover amid tepid job creation. The Nikkei fell 2.2%, with
banks an exporters suffering. Banks slumped Monday's sell-off in their
European counterparts.

Ã‚Â 

In Europe, equity markets were bouncing back from their prior session
sharp sell-off; however the move higher appeared to be technical, as debt
crisis jitters and fears of a full blown banking crisis, amid recession
fears remained. Swiss stocks were receiving a boost after its central
bank said it t would act to fight an overvaluation of the franc

Ã‚Â 

The euro was climbing against the dollar, while Crude oil was falling
2.08% to $84.65 per barrel. Flight to safety was helping gold prices. The
bullion was gaining 0.98% to $1895.3 an ounce, while silver was losing
1.38% to $42.475 an ounce.

Ã‚Â 

On economic news, at 10 am, the August ISM Services will be released,
with economists expecting it probably dropped to 51, its slowest pace in
more than a year.

Ã‚Â 

TodayÃ¢Â€Â™s Stocks to Watch: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Baidu.com
(NASDAQ:BIDU), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), lululemon
Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU), Molycorp (NYSE:MCP), PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), and
Sunoco (NYSE:SUN).

Ã‚Â 

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the maker of iPads and iPhones, was falling 1.22% to
$369.50 in pre-market, trading below its 50day moving average at $370.57,
amid a weak tape on euro debt and economic fears. Over the long holiday
weekend, Samsung said that a Dusseldorf court granted AppleÃ¢Â€Â™s
request to ban sales and marketing of its Galaxy 10.1 tablet in Germany
in the latest of the patent wars between both companies. Additionally,
the International Trade Commission said that it would review a July 1st
finding that Apple violates patents held by S3 Graphics Co. In other news
around the web, according to reports out of China, Apple is preparing to
open its first store in Hong Kong, as the tech giant looks to capitalize
from the surging demand for its products like iPhones and iPads in China
and neighboring regions. There were also rumors surrounding the iPhone 5
launch with Sprint, with several blogs citing reports that a contractor
installed or would be installing CDMA/3G and WiMAX repeaters to boost
SprintÃ¢Â€Â™ signal in an Apple store in a mall in Texas. Last week,
Apple was not able to gain any traction amid the weak market, with shares
stumbling 2.48%.

Ã‚Â 

Baidu.com (NASDAQ:BIDU), the largest Chinese Internet search engine, was
tumbling 2.81% to $136.50, trading below its 20day moving average at
$139. The company announced that it had partnered with Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)
to develop tablet computers and mobile phones, targeting the Chinese
market and perhaps also international markets now dominated by Apple
(NASDAQ:AAPL) or other GoogleÃ¢Â€Â™s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android based devices.
The Chinese company offered a glimpse of its upcoming mobile operating
system and launched a new mobile application platform last week aimed at
bolstering its presence in the mobile web market. Dell said that the
partnership will take advantage of its Streak 5 tablet, an Android based
tablet that was discontinued in U.S. last month.Ã‚Â  Dell shares were
surging 10.25% to $15.70 in pre-market, trading above calculated
resistance at $15.13, as the partnership with Baidu opens an opportunity
mainly to the large and growing Chinese market.

Ã‚Â 

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the largest U.S. lender, was falling 2.05% to
$7.05 in pre-market, as participants react to the European market
sell-off from the prior session, which was led by the banks on concerns
over a deepening sovereign debt crisis, which could spark a full blown
pan European banking crisis, and the impacts over the U.S. Federal
Housing Agency lawsuit, seeking to recover losses from mortgage back
securities that according to the agency were not properly represented.
According to the Financial Times, big banks, including BofA and JPMorgan
that had been in talks with prosecutors to settle claims of improper
mortgage practices, like robo-signing, have been offered a deal that
could limit or release the lenders from liability for wrongful
securitization practices. The Charlotte, NC based bank lost last week
6.57% amid concerns over mortgage putback liability, amid a new lawsuit
from the U.S. government and weak economic data. Shares of Bank of
America have practically erased the entire bump received from news of
Warren Buffet investing $5 billion in the company last month.

Ã‚Â 

lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU), the designer and retailer of athletic
apparel, will be in focus after Jefferies raised its target price to $56
from $43 ahead of its quarterly results later, scheduled for later in the
week. On average analysts expect a profit of $0.22 per share on revenues
of $206 million. lululemon has calculated support at $44.27 and
resistance at $57.90.

Ã‚Â 

Molycorp (NYSE:MCP), the owner of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest non-Chinese
rare earth metals deposits, will be in focus after rare earth mines in
Eastern China to halt output. According to China Daily, Eastern Ganzhou
City ordered three of its eight major rare earth producing counties to
halt production by the end of this year, as the three counties are mining
areas that are allowed to be exploited. The notice also told the counties
to set production quotas to rare earth mines to prevent
over-exploitation. Molycorp has calculated support at $49.37 and
resistance at $58.48.

Ã‚Â 

PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), the Michigan based homebuilder, was falling 0.46%
to $4.36 on the weak tape and as Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its
coveted Conviction Buy List. PulteGroup has calculated support at $3.40
and resistance at $5.16. Last week, Pulte was upgraded to a Buy from
Neutral at Ticonderoga, with the firm setting its target price at $6.50.

Ã‚Â 

Sunoco (NYSE:SUN), the energy company involved in logistics, retail and
refining businesses, will be in focus after announcing plans to exit its
crude oil refining business, starting the process to sell its refineries
located in Philadelphia and Marcus Hook, PA. Sunoco also announced that
it has started a comprehensive review of the company to determine the
best way to unlock shareholder value and maximize the potential for
Sunoco's logistics and retail businesses. Recently, the company completed
the separation of SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SXC) and the sale of the chemical
businesses, which together with the decision to exit refining marks a
fundamental shift away from manufacturing that, will re-position the
company. According to the Sunoco, it will pursue all options to sell its
refineries, but if a suitable transaction cannot be implemented, the
company intends to idle the main processing units at the facilities in
July 2012. Sunoco has calculated support at $33.01 and resistance at
$38.92.
