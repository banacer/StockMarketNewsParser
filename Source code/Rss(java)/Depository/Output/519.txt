Opportunity Within Market Turmoil - Research Report on Flow International
Corporation and Eaton Vance Corp.














MACAU, Sep 06, 2011 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) -- Today,
www.EquityMarketsInc.com announced its research report highlighting Flow
International Corporation and Eaton Vance Corp. . Full content and
research is available at www.EquityMarketsInc.com/research.php .

Continued confidence in long-term U.S. debt is defying S&P's recent
downgrade. Treasury yields continue at their lowest levels since January
1, 2011 as the market moved to "safe investments" weary of the storm
clouds ahead. Winds can change however, as a last-minute move to save the
U.S. from a historic default on its debt obligations. Attentions are now
turned to the situation in Europe, with the health of the Euro in the
balance; bankers are looking to prevent defaults on Italian and Spanish
debt.

As a result of recent credit adjustments, opportunity is being marked for
investors to take advantage of equities with high-margin and specialty
products. Market-wise investors are carefully watching for value within
equities boasting established pipelines and excellent growth prospects.
As part of this process, the following companies have been introduced
with initial research reports available online.

technology-based global company providing waterjet cutting, surface
preparation and cleaning solutions. The full research report on Flow
