  Google Places falls prey to games on the search engine, with business
  rivals apparently clicking a label to get the competition's shop to
  surface as closed on Places listings.

  Google is getting gamed, again. Malicious perpetrators are exploiting
  the Google Places to report that businesses have closed when they are
  really still open.

  Google Places is the company's local search service, which was revamped
  in April 2010 to offer business information, such as address, phone
  numbers, reviews, photos and other kernels of information for searchers.

  One of the features of Places has in its "report a problem" section
  enables users to click a link that lets Google knows when a business
  may have closed, warning users not to waste their time driving to
  defunct establishments.

  This activity, a form of crowdsourcing, lets Google users helps the
  search engine, which said it can't be on the grounds in every city or
  town, serve its customers with relevant information. Unfortunately, the
  way this crowdsourcing option is set up lends itself too easily to
  abuse.

  When enough users click the problem option "this place is permanently
  closed," Places lists the business as "reportedly closed." Pending
  review, the shop is labeled "permanently closed."

  Google said that two weeks ago it noted that abuse of "place closed"
  spam labels -- was occurring. As noted by the New York Times, reporting
  a business closed on Google Places "has become an increasingly common
  tactic among unscrupulous competitors."

  Apparently, rivals in various business niches are displaying nasty
  competitive streaks by clicking places closed. Google, which declined
  to say how many instances of abuse it has detected, said in a corporate
  blog post it has been tweaking the system to halt such incorrect
  labeling and will roll out the changes soon.

  "We know that accurate listings on Google Maps are an important tool
  for many business owners. We take reports of spam and abuse very
  seriously and do our best to ensure the accuracy of a listing before
  updating it," Google Places Senior Product Manager Ethan Russell wrote
  Sept. 6.

  "That being said, we apologize to both business owners and users for
  any frustration this recent issue of spam labeling has caused, and
  we're committed to making sure that users and potential customers
  continue to have the most up-to-date and accurate information possible."

  This is hardly the first issue Google Places has had this year that
  required some adjustment on the search engine's part. Google Places
  once aggregated big chunks of information from local search rivals
  Yelp, Urbanspoon, CitySearch, TripAdvisor and more sources before these
  smaller concerns complained.

  Google, which is weathering an antitrust investigation from the Federal
  Trade Commission over whether or not it has treated rivals like Yelp
  unfairly, now relies more heavily on its own Hotpot recommendation
  engine.

  This also isn't the first time Google search has been gamed. Google
  last December altered its search algorithm to prohibit Website
  proprietors from boosting search rankings by mistreating customers.
  Earlier this year, search engine went so far as to punish J.C. Penney
  and others for boosting their rankings on Google.com.
