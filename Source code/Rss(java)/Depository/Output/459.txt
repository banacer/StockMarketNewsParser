Sensory Networks Releases DPI Software Optimized for Cavium OCTEON(R) II
Processors



HyperScan(TM) Content Scanning Engine Delivers Multi-Tens of Gigabit DPI
Performance With Linear Scalability
















MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, Sep 06, 2011 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) -- Sensory
Networks, the leading provider of pattern matching software technology,
today announced availability of its HyperScan(TM) engine with optimized
support for the OCTEON(R) II MIPS64 multi-core processor series from
Cavium, Inc., a leading provider of semiconductor products that enable
intelligent processing for networking, communications, and the digital
home. The new release of HyperScan supports dual-core to 32-core OCTEON
II processors, and when benchmarked with a database of complex regular
expressions, targeted at intrusion prevention from a tier-1 equipment
vendor, delivered Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) throughput of 3Gbps using
just two OCTEON II cores, while also capable of delivering over 40Gbps on
a 32-core OCTEON II processor with linear scalability.

"We've made tremendous progress in making HyperScan agnostic to any type
of CPU architecture and operating system, while ensuring solid DPI
performance and scalability," said Sab Gosal, CEO of Sensory Networks.
"While support for the OCTEON II processor series enables us to meet our
customers' immediate needs, we look forward to continuing to work with
Cavium on further advancing the HyperScan-OCTEON II solution."

"The content inspection performance and linear scalability, delivered by
Sensory Networks' HyperScan, is most impressive and much needed in a
market where demand for DPI-driven applications such as security, URL
filtering and application recognition is growing rapidly," said John
Bromhead, Director of Product Marketing at Cavium. "We are pleased to see
Sensory optimizing their software on our market-leading OCTEON II
processors for the emerging market place."

"Our experience in developing innovative algorithms for matching large
sets of regular expressions has enabled us to deliver excellent
performance on a variety of architectures," said Geoff Langdale, CTO of
Sensory Networks. "In addition to high DPI throughput, HyperScan provides
a number of advantages in other critical areas including low latency,
small packet performance, pattern database compilation time, and runtime
memory usage. Our native support for streaming also makes more complex
functionality, such as cross-packet inspection, easy to implement."

HyperScan is a portable, easy-to-integrate software pattern matching
engine intended for integration into networking and security OEM
platforms. The engine supports a wide range of applications that rely on
pattern matching tasks, whether it is scanning for just a single pattern,
or a large database comprising hundreds of thousands of patterns. The
engine also supports a broad range of regular expression constructs and
provides powerful cross-packet inspection functionality. This software
solution significantly streamlines the engineering and design process by
giving equipment vendors the opportunity to perform a one-time
integration, into a system release, thereby allowing HyperScan to be used
for an entire product line, low-end to high-end. The opportunity to also
upgrade legacy products, already installed in the field, provides for
further market-competitive gains. This flexibility and scalability
directly translates into substantial improvements in price/performance
efficiencies, simplified operations, and a tremendous product
time-to-market advantage.

HyperScan is provided under a simple license framework that is not only
cost-effective, compared to alternative solutions, but also allows
equipment vendors to use the technology for multiple projects across
multiple product lines. For ease of integration, this engine is designed
with a simple API and is supplied with a benchmarking tool, documentation
and the necessary technical assistance to ensure a quick and easy
integration.

About Sensory Networks Sensory Networks is a provider of software pattern
matching software that enables networking and security equipment vendors
to significantly improve the content scanning intelligence and
price/performance of their platforms that support a wide range of
applications including Intrusion Prevention (IPS), Deep Packet Inspection
(DPI), Unified Threat Management (UTM) and Content Filtering. The
Company's HyperScan software engine, while running on low cost, off the
shelf platforms, is designed to operate with a wide range of CPU
architectures, operating systems to accelerate content scanning
throughput performance up to 10Gbps, per CPU core, depending on the
signature and system workload. Sensory Networks is headquartered in
Mountain View, Calif., and has a R&D center in Sydney, Australia. For
