By Tiernan Ray


Lazard Capital’s Daniel Amir this morning writes that Broadcom (BRCM) may
be instituting its first hiring freeze since 2008 because of broad
worries about the economy.

Amir doesn’t say where he draws the conclusion, other than to refer to
“channel checks.”

The company may, too, have some concerns over the pace of sales, as Amir
writes that “this quarter will be very back-end loaded, more so than the
typical quarter with close to 50% of revenues coming in September.”

Amir is modeling $1.98 billion in revenue and 70 cents per share in
profit this quarter. That is slightly higher than the Street’s $1.95
billion, but below the 76-cent consensus profit estimate.

Amir maintains a Buy rating on Broadcom shares and a $48 price target.

Broadcom shares this morning are down $1.42, or 4%, at $33.15 in early
trading.
