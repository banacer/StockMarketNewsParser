Dialogic and Voiceserve Collaborate on Mobile Video Conferencing Solution



Solution Enables Enterprises and Service Providers to Address Growing
Demands for Multimedia Communications While Reducing Development and
Deployment Costs
















MILPITAS, CA, Sep 06, 2011 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) -- Dialogic Inc. , a
leading provider of communications technologies that power advanced
networks, today announced it has teamed up with VoipSwitch, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Voiceserve, Inc. , to successfully develop and
validate an open standards-based mobile video conferencing solution based
on the technology components commercially available from both companies.
The combined solution provides for SIP-based mobile video conferencing
from Android and iPhone smartphones using off-the-shelf smartphone video
client applications, rather than non standards-compliant proprietary
networks and terminals. This in turn enables enterprises and service
providers to employ a cost effective approach to developing and deploying
mobile and multimedia communications, using the efficiencies of cloud
computing.

Today, video communication solutions are predominantly built using
proprietary networks, protocols and codecs from recognized industry
players. This is largely attributed to the extensive amount of
experimentation required to develop an open standards-based solution. For
example, providers need to test SIP clients for interoperability with
multimedia service delivery platforms, as well as ensure that SIP video
calls are able to get through firewalls.

Recognizing this challenge, Dialogic and VoipSwitch combined VoipSwitch's
Vippie SIP-based smartphone client application, based on Dialogic(R)
multimedia processing software, to develop a proof-of-concept that can
significantly decrease the time and cost required to create open and
modular standards-based mobile video communication solutions. Because the
solution is software-based, it provides for the quick delivery of
scalable and reliable new services. The solution also incorporates the
Dialogic(R) BorderNet(TM) 500 Gateway, a session border controller that
allows clients to make SIP calls on the Internet from anywhere and
enables them to deploy the solution in hosted or cloud environments.

"For far too long expensive proprietary platforms have proven to be a
barrier of entry to the video conferencing market," stated Michael
Bibelman, CEO of Voiceserve, Inc. "We are pleased to join forces with
Dialogic to develop a solution to help change the industry landscape by
overcoming this significant obstacle."

"Demand for mobile multimedia services is poised to continue to increase
and, as it does, it is important that the right tools are available to
developers to help meet this demand. We are excited that through our
collaboration with a great company like VoipSwitch, we were able to
develop a more accessible mobile video conferencing tool for the
developer community," said Franz-Josef Eberle, Vice President and General
Manager, VAS and Cloud Enabling Unit at Dialogic. "We look forward to
seeing the innovations that will develop as a result of the combined
solution."

Dialogic will demonstrate the mobile video conferencing solution set at
IT Expo West in Austin, and the Rural Cellular Association - Fall Expo
2011 in Las Vegas the week of September 12th.
