For many of us, living on dividends and/or having a lined-up cash-flow
from dividends is essential. A strong retirement account requires solid
and stable dividend income. Therefore, I analyzed the top yield
U.S.-based companies that offer solid dividends.

The compiled list consists of 33 companies that paid fat dividend checks
in the trailing twelve months. During that period, these companies
generated a dividend yield of at least 5%. They also have a minimum
market cap of $1 billion and a maximum trailing P/E ratio of 20. I set
the forward P/E ratio to be lower than 20, as well.

Analysts estimate these stocks to show positive EPS growth in the next 5
years. Setting the parameters as such ensures a sustainable 5% yield
without crossing a payout ratio of 100%. I have investigated these stocks
from a fundamental perspective, adding my O-Metrix Grading System where
applicable. Here is the ultimate dividend list of 2011:

Data from Finviz/Morningstar, and is current as of September 2.

Utility Stocks

6 Utility Stocks fall into my screening criteria. Duke Energy, Entergy,
Integrys, Hawaiian, Vectren, and Progress Energy offer yields above 5%
and are priced with P/E ratios lower than 20. Among these companies,
Entergy has the highest O-Metrix score followed by Integrys. Entergy has
the highest O-Metrix score, since it is priced with a single digit P/E
ratio. It also has a lower payout ratio of 47%.

Integrys’s O-Metrix score is higher due to 7% annualized EPS growth
expectation for the next 5 years. If you are not familiar with these two
names, I would recommend Duke Energy since it offers a yield of 5.32%,
and is priced with a relatively low P/E ratio of 12.19. I expect Duke’s
alliance with Progress Energy to offer both companies a competitive edge
in terms of larger economies of scale.

Technology Stocks

Naturally, all technology companies in the list are telecommunication
service providers. With a single digit P/E ratio and 51% payout ratio,
AT&T is the undisputed winner in this group. Verizon is also okay. It has
a higher EPS growth estimate of 8.48%.

Centurylink was able to make it to the ultimate dividend list, but I am
not sure about the sustainability. It offers a yield of 8.49%, the best
among telecom titans. However, the payout ratio of 144% is a strong red
flag. I could have been more comfortable with sustainability, if Century
had enough liquid assets to back its yield. However with a current ratio
of 0.99, current assets barely backup the current debt. Century is among
the 4 yields that look unsustainable.

Financial Stocks

Initially I was thinking of excluding financial stocks from this
analysis, since there is so much volatility regarding both their share
prices and dividend payments. However, the finance-related stocks,
especially the diversified real estate investment trusts, lost too much
in the recent sell-off, offering good entry points. REITS still come with
their own risks, namely the default risk, depending on their exposure to
risky investment. At the same time, they could be strong outperformers.

Based on the average P/E ratios, current dividend yields, and future EPS
growth estimations, the REITS have the highest O-Metrix scores. American
Capital Agency has the top O-Metrix score of 24.39, followed by Chimera
Investments (24.02). Annaly Capital has a score of 12.20. If the REITs
are too risky, Kohlberg K. Roberts, First Niagara Financial, and NY
Community Bank have O-Metrix scores of 16.75, 9.49, and 6.47,
respectively.

Consumer Goods

Two tobacco companies make into the ultimate dividend list. With a yield
of 5.72%, RAI has an O-Metrix score of 4.70, followed by Altria which has
a yield of 5.69% and an O-Metrix score of 4.26.

Missouri-based Leggett & Platt is a lesser-known company that has great
return potential. It is trading with a trailing P/E ratio 18 and forward
P/E ratio of 12.5. Analysts estimate an annualized EPS growth of 13.75%
for the next 5 years. With a nifty yield of 5.21%, the company has an
O-Metrix score of 6.18.

Basic Materials

Partnerships dominate the basic materials portion of the top dividends
list. Partnerships distribute a serious portion of their income and their
payout ratio is pretty high. That is one of the reasons why they make it
into the top dividends list. Thanks to their nifty distributions, they
are pretty popular among retirees. I like these partnerships; they can be
great diversifiers with low Beta values. Given their correlations with
energy prices, I would wait for a pull-back to add into my portfolio.

Alliance Resources is trading with a single digit P/E ratio and it has an
O-Metrix score of 8.13. Sunoco Logistics is also among my favorites with
an O-Metrix score of 5.48. TC Pipelines has a score of 4.89.

Southern Copper lost almost 30% since January, offering a deep value with
6.76% yield. Analysts estimate an annualized EPS growth of 25% for the
next 5 years. With an average P/E ratio of 11.61, the stock is priced for
5% EPS growth. It could be a huge outperformer if analysts’ estimates
hold.

  Guess I didn't buy low enough or right enough to show these returns in
  the last year - just sold the utilities and the aristocrats recently
  left town, too. Don't know if I'll have a dime left to revisit my old
  favorites over the next five years, but thanks for the article.
