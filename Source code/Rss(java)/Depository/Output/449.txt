4-Star Stocks Poised to Pop: BE Aerospace


By Brian D. Pacampara | More Articles
September 6, 2011 | Comments (0)


Based on the aggregated intelligence of 180,000-plus investors
participating in Motley Fool CAPS, the Fool's free investing community,
commercial aircraft manufacturer BE Aerospace (Nasdaq: BEAV &nbsp;) has
earned a respected four-star ranking.

With that in mind, let's take a closer look at BE Aerospace's business
and see what CAPS investors are saying about the stock right now.

BE Aerospace facts

Headquarters (Founded) Wellington, Fla. (1987)
Market Cap $3.31 billion
Industry Aerospace and defense
Trailing-12-Month Revenue $2.25 billion
Management 

Co-Founder/Chairman/CEO Amin Khoury

President/COO Werner Lieberherr

Return on Equity (Average, Past 3 Years) 3.8%
Cash/Debt $193.2 million / $1.25 billion

Sources: Capital IQ (a division of Standard & Poor's) and Motley Fool
CAPS.

On CAPS, 96% of the 589 members who have rated BE Aerospace believe the
stock will outperform the S&P 500 going forward. These bulls include
robertshrestha and fellow Fool Alex Planes (TMFBiggles).

Just last week , robertshrestha listed several of BE Aerospace's
positives: "Reasonable forward valuation, growing revenues and operating
income, record bookings, recovering global passenger traffic. Lots of
things to like here."

Over the next five years, in fact, BE Aerospace is expected to grow its
bottom line at a solid rate of 13% annually. That's faster than other
aerospace and defense plays like Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT &nbsp;)
(9.5%), Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC &nbsp;) (8%), and Raytheon (NYSE: RTN
&nbsp;) (9%).

Alex elaborates on the BE Aerospace bull case:
There aren't a lot of companies (except maybe Spirit AeroSystems) that
stand to benefit more from the huge backlog of plane orders that both
Boeing and Airbus are carrying. Well north of 10,000 commercial airplanes
(I forget the exact combined number, but you can find it on their
websites) that nee d to be built, and a lot of them will need upmarket
seats, and nearly all of them will need food and beverage systems. The
faster Boeing and Airbus roll out new planes, the better it is for B/E.
