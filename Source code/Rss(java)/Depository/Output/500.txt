Endologix Receives IDE Approval for the Ventana(TM) Fenestrated Stent
Graft System














IRVINE, Calif., Sep 6, 2011 (GlobeNewswire via COMTEX) -- Endologix, Inc.
, developer and marketer of minimally invasive treatments for aortic
disorders, announced today that it has received Investigational Device
Exemption ("IDE") conditional approval from the United States Food and
Drug Administration ("FDA") to begin U.S. clinical trials to evaluate the
Ventana(TM) Fenestrated Stent Graft System for the endovascular repair of
juxtarenal and pararenal aortic aneurysms. Endologix expects to begin
enrolling patients at a few centers in the U.S. before the end of this
year.

The Ventana(TM) device is a new aortic extension designed to be used with
the AFX(R) Endovascular AAA System and Xpand(TM) renal stent grafts. The
AFX system is commercially available in the U.S. and expected to be
available in other international markets in 2012. The Ventana(TM) and
Xpand(TM) stent grafts are not approved for marketing in the U.S. or
abroad and are restricted to investigational use only.

U.S. National Principal Investigator Daniel G. Clair, MD (Chairman,
Department of Vascular Surgery, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland,
OH) commented, "The initial clinical experience with Ventana outside of
the U.S. has been very positive. International results demonstrate proof
of concept for this innovative system, which is the first off-the-shelf
endovascular option for patients with juxtarenal and pararenal aortic
aneurysms. On behalf of the Ventana IDE investigators, we look forward to
initiating the clinical program in the U.S. and furthering the research
efforts on this promising technology."

John McDermott, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "We are
delighted to receive the U.S. FDA conditional IDE approval, and are
encouraged by the initial positive outcomes with Ventana in clinical
studies outside the U.S. It is estimated that 20% of diagnosed abdominal
aortic aneurysms are not treatable with currently approved endovascular
devices. Ventana potentially provides these patients with an innovative
and less-invasive alternative to open repair. We look forward to
collaborating with the Ventana clinical investigators on the IDE trial
and are hopeful to provide a new endovascular therapy for patients with
complex aortic aneurysms in the years ahead."

About Endologix, Inc.

Endologix, Inc. develops and manufactures minimally invasive treatments
for aortic disorders. The Company's focus is endovascular stent grafts
for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). AAA is a weakening
of the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in the body, resulting in a
balloon-like enlargement. Once AAA develops, it continues to enlarge and,
if left untreated, becomes increasingly susceptible to rupture. The
overall patient mortality rate for ruptured AAA is approximately 75%,
making it a leading cause of death in the U.S. Additional information can
be found on Endologix's Web site at www.endologix.com .

of which are beyond the control of Endologix. Many factors may cause
actual results to differ materially from anticipated results, including

looking statements. Please refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and the Company's other
