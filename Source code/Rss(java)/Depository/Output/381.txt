Trading Idea - Is Amgen close to Resistance?

New York, September 6th (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Amgen Inc.
(NASDAQ:AMGN) are trading very close to calculated resistance at $55.83
with the current price action closing at just $54.10 placing the stock
near levels that make it difficult to buy.

Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) develops, manufactures, and markets human
therapeutics based on cellular and molecular biology. The company
concentrates on the areas of hematology, cancer, infectious disease,
endocrinology, neurobiology, and inflammation.

Amgen's current stock range is defined by current calculated support
defined at $47.66 and by the resistance level at $55.83, the stock is
clearly over-extended from support, making it difficult to establishing
new long positions at this level.

Traders don't have a clear entry point for Amgen, as the stock is well
above support, however, as the stock pulls back towards $47.66 it will
definitely provide a reference point to establish a trade. On the other
hand if the stock decides to break above resistance level at $55.83 then
traders will get an opportunity to enter Amgen stock by establishing a
position as the stock moves to a higher range.
