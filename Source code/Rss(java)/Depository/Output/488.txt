Ditech Networks' PhoneTag Solution Rings Up Tier 1 European Mobile
Carrier Win




















MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Sep 06, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Ditech Networks
today announced that it recently entered into a contract with a major
European mobile carrier for voice to text services. Ditech Networks is
now working closely with this carrier to trial and launch voicemail to
text and related applications to mobile subscribers across Europe.

"Last February, Ditech announced that the PhoneTag Auto service had been
extended to include additional languages, including Spanish, French, and
German," said Ken Naumann, president and CEO of Ditech Networks. "We
believe that this capability was instrumental in our win with this
carrier." The additional languages enable carriers in Europe and South
America to offer a wider range of value added voice services, using the
highly accurate PhoneTag Auto platform.

PhoneTag Auto is a fully automated voicemail transcription service that,
in a third party study of automated English transcription services,
surpassed several other competitors in accuracy and consistency. PhoneTag
Auto is available as a cloud service, or on premises behind the firewall
for enterprises with a need to preserve data within their own network. In
addition to its PhoneTag Auto offering, Ditech also offers PhoneTag
Hybrid and PhoneTag Live in multiple languages today.

Cautionary Statement

This press release contains statements relating to Ditech Networks'
contract with a Tier 1 European Mobile carrier. This contract does not
provide for guaranteed revenues or deployments by this carrier. Actual
revenues and deployments may not materialize as a result of a variety of
factors, including the carrier may delay deploying, or not deploy, Ditech
Networks' voicemail to text solutions due to capital expenditure
constraints, the product's capabilities, Ditech Networks' competitors may
develop products and services that compete favorably with Ditech
Networks' products and services, or for other unanticipated reasons.
Further risks inherent in Ditech Networks' business are detailed in the
section entitled "Risk Factors" in Ditech Networks' Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2011 (filed July 28, 2011 with
