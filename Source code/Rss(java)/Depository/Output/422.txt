Baidu Approaching its 50 Day

Written by TradersHuddle Staff

New York, September 6th (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Baidu, Inc.
(NASDAQ:BIDU) closed the trading session at $140.45 near its 50 day
moving average currently set at $144.07. Baidu's price action is below
this important level, which makes the stock difficult to buy, as there
will certainly be resistance as it approaches its 50 day.

Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) provides Chinese language Internet search
services primarily in China and Japan. The Company offers algorithmic
search, enterprise search, pay for performance and news, MP3, and image
searches.

Latest price action range, defined by a peaks and troughs algorithm
places calculated support at $125.11 and calculated resistance at
$151.11. These levels will be closely watched by traders, as they provide
great insight into the latest price dynamics defined by Baidu shares.

Traders should evaluate their trade if they want to establish a position
on Baidu given the resistance expected as the stock approaches the 50 day
moving average. A trade might materialize as the stock manages to break
this important level, as it could be used as support going forward,
however until the break materializes buying the stock is nothing
different than flipping a coin. Other levels that traders will be
evaluating are the ones defined by the peak and troughs algorithm that
provides great price level reference points.
