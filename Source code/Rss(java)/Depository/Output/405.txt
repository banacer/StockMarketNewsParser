LOS ANGELES √¢¬Ä¬ì The inaugural Call of Duty XP event was unlike
anything I√¢¬Ä¬ôve ever experienced before. It was like a Disneyland for
gamers with some X-Games, real Navy SEALs, and Hollywood talent thrown in
for good measure. XP 2011 treated approximately 8,000 die-hard Call of
Duty fans to a two-day festival focused on Modern Warfare 3 multiplayer,
as well as real-life thrill rides staged by actual soldiers that were
ripped straight from Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops.

I√¢¬Ä¬ôm sure Howard Hughes, who originally built the 12-acre compound
that hosted XP to construct his Spruce Goose plane, rolled over in his
grave. The recluse wouldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt want to see so many people flooding his
hangars or hear the reverberating sounds of machine gun fire outside in
the numerous obstacle courses.

But those who attended soaked everything in. Fans stood in line for hours
to get 20 minutes of hands-on time with a game that they√¢¬Ä¬ôll own come
November 8. Many of them will likely stand in line again on November 7 to
be the first to take home Modern Warfare 3, which is expected to top
Black Ops and become the biggest game launch of all time.

In today√¢¬Ä¬ôs connected world, early adopters are vital to the success
of video games. Sure, journalists still play their important role. But
game publishers devote a lot of time and resources to their active
communities for big franchises, whether it√¢¬Ä¬ôs Call of Duty or
Electronic Arts√¢¬Ä¬ô Madden. XP 2011 reached far beyond the 8,000 fans
who attended the event ó who actively spread the word amongst their
online friends on Facebook and Twitter, as well as on Xbox Live and
PlayStation Network. Activision livestreamed the majority of the event to
its entire fan base. And Microsoft, a title sponsor of the event,
actively connected with its community with exclusive videos and coverage.

And that was just the tip of the information iceberg. Activision invited
approximately 350 journalists from around the globe to XP 2011. For
media, the event kicked off a day early on September 1. Eric Hirshberg,
CEO of Activision Publishing, kicked off the Labor Day weekend event by
saying, √¢¬Ä¬úThis weekend is all about our incredible fan base of over
30 million gamers. We want to give them a kick-ass experience that they
can√¢¬Ä¬ôt get anywhere else.√¢¬Ä¬ù

There was plenty of new to report. Microsoft announced a new $400 limited
edition Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Xbox 360 console, which will come
with the new game, two wireless controllers, a headset with Bluetooth,
and a specially designed look. Activision announced the $100 Call of
Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Hardened Edition, which will include a 100-page
journal, a Special Ops Juggernaut Avatar outfit (for Xbox 360), special
DLC, special cover art, a steel case, and Founder status and a
year√¢¬Ä¬ôs membership to Call of Duty Elite.

Modern Warfare 3 developers Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games were on
hand to take a deep dive into multiplayer and then offer hands-on
gameplay with five maps and new game modes, as well as the Spec Ops co-op
Survival mode. Beachhead Studios used the event to detail Call of Duty
Elite√¢¬Ä¬ôs premium subscription service, which will cost $50 a year and
introduce a brand new revenue stream for Activision.

That√¢¬Ä¬ôs good news for Activision, which has already seen digital
revenues rise 22% to $1.7 billion for the 12 month period ending in June
2011. Activision reportedly sold 18 million Black Ops DLC map packs and
over 25 million copies of the game. The average Black Ops player spent
$76 per copy. That was up from 11 million packs sold on 19 million copies
of Modern Warfare 2 and 9 million packs sold on 13 million copies of
World at War.

Call of Duty has a larger online community of gamers than sister company
Blizzard Entertainment√¢¬Ä¬ôs World of Warcraft. And with Elite offering
a lot of content for the $50 subscription, including monthly DLC
downloads of new maps, game modes and content, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs likely the
active community members will skip the traditional pay-as-you-go DLC
offerings and opt in for the subscription. Plus, many gamers will likely
purchase the Hardened Edition of the game just for the $50 value of
online content.

Michael Pachter, video game analyst for Wedbush Morgan Securities,
believes Elite will generate $50 million in incremental revenue for
Activision in 2012 alone. And that number will grow.

At XP 2011, Activision was able to grab the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs attention and
steal some thunder from rival Electronic Arts√¢¬Ä¬ô Battlefield 3, which
will ship October 25 and offer up the most serious competition the Call
of Duty franchise has seen yet. Both Activision and EA are poised to
spend over $100 million each in marketing these two games. According to
Pachter, the event cost about $2 million, but it was sponsored so
Microsoft, Mountain Dew, Jeep and others kicked in funds. Activision
certainly got a return on its investment √¢¬Ä¬ì as well as an event that
could sustain an annual fan base much like Blizzard√¢¬Ä¬ôs BlizzCon,
which has been going strong enough to sell out an entire convention
center each year.

And BlizzCon doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt feature Jeep Experience rides, which send
gamers into a recreated combat zone with real Navy SEALs grabbing them
from the Call of Duty Edition Jeeps and helping them escape through a
bunker filled with dead terrorists as loud gunfire (blanks) erupt. Nor
does BlizzCon, which is a celebration of fantasy and sci-fi worlds,
offers fans a chance to zip line high across the compound soaring at 60
miles per hour. And then there was the Scrapyard, a recreation of a
Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer level, where 16 vs. 16 players competed in
paintball (for those who√¢¬Ä¬ôve never engaged in the activity,
paintballs do leave bruises).

  I like what Activision is doing. They will put out all the stops to
  make sure the gaming public recogonizes Call of Duty. This is why
  theyíre #1. They donít just settle for small things, they go big every
  year. So far Modern Warfare 3 seems like its going to be the best game
  they have released so far as theyíre making all the minor improvements
  to fine tune this gaming series. Throw that it in with a few new modes
  and you have the best game and it will shatter more records. I was
  checking out http://mwarfare3.com and they had new screenshots of the
  multiplayer. Iím just excited to get my hands on this come November.
