New TomoTherapy Emerald Service Program Combines Best in Class Product
Service Offerings with Guaranteed Uptime for Unparalleled Reliability and
Customer Satisfaction
















SUNNYVALE, Calif., Sept. 6, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Accuray
Incorporated , the premier radiation oncology company, announced today
the extension of its Emerald Service Program to the TomoTherapyÃ‚Â®
Radiation Therapy System, building on the company's legacy as an industry
leader in customer service. The Emerald Program for TomoTherapy customers
provides end-to-end product updates and protection that advances clinical
uptime and utilization.

Accuray created a new paradigm in service agreements with the
introduction of the Emerald and Diamond Service Programs for the
CyberKnifeÃ‚Â® Robotic Radiosurgery System. Unlike traditional service
plans--which provide basic break/fix protection--Accuray's Diamond Plus
Service Program includes upgrade protection and guaranteed 98 percent
uptime, ensuring that its systems are in optimal condition to provide
world-class patient care. Accuray's long-standing commitment to customer
care is reflected in the company's recent Net PromotorÃ‚Â® Score (NPS),
which measures customer satisfaction in a stringent fashion taking into
consideration both promoters and detractors. From 2010 to 2011, customer
satisfaction with the CyberKnife System increased nine percentage points,
scoring an industry best of 66 percent, making Accuray and the CyberKnife
System the top-ranked company for customer satisfaction in the U.S. in
Radiation Oncology.

"Our participation in Accuray's Diamond Plus Service Program has yielded
benefits from day one," said David Taliaferro, vice president of
Operations for Advanced Medical Centers and CyberKnife manager at
Erlanger in Chattanooga, TN. "'From installation to go live to ongoing
treatment planning support, to well trained on-site field service
engineers...' Accuray's service is second to none. In addition to
comprehensive product protection, our service agreement ensures that we
receive the latest upgrades and up-to-the-minute enhancements that enable
us to keep our system and our radiosurgery program on the cutting edge.
As a result, we can be confident that our patients receive the best in
stereotactic radiosurgical care."

Now, TomoTherapy customers can benefit from one of the unparalleled
service programs that CyberKnife customers have come to rely on with the
Emerald Program. The Emerald Program for TomoTherapy customers combines
the value of the standard manufacturer's warranty with access to the
finest technical support, 24/7 telephone support and technology updates.
If required, an on-site Accuray engineer is available for dispatch. The
most reliable equipment protection agreement in the marketplace, the
Emerald Service Program guarantees 98 percent uptime* for TomoTherapy
customers*.

TomoTherapy service recently earned the highest user satisfaction
composite rating among linear accelerator vendors in MD Buyline's
Quarterly User Satisfaction Report. Specifically, TomoTherapy Systems
were found to exceed the market average in system performance, service
response time and service repair quality. In addition, from 2010 to 2011,
the NPS score for TomoTherapy increased 13%, which represents the most
dramatic rise in the industry. Access to the Emerald Service Program will
build upon TomoTherapy's foundation in customer satisfaction by ensuring
that customer's uptime is preserved and maintained at a minimum of 98
percent.

"Accuray has a rich heritage of providing innovative service products to
our customers," said Euan S. Thomson, Ph.D., president and chief
executive officer of Accuray. "Extension of the Emerald Service Program
to TomoTherapy products demonstrates our continued commitment to leading
the industry in service quality, uptime and customer satisfaction at a
uniformed price."
