4-Star Stocks Poised to Pop: Akamai


By Brian D. Pacampara | More Articles
September 6, 2011 | Comments (0)


Based on the aggregated intelligence of 180,000-plus investors
participating in Motley Fool CAPS, the Fool's free investing community,
Internet content delivery specialist Akamai Technologies (Nasdaq: AKAM
&nbsp;) has earned a respected four-star ranking.

With that in mind, let's take a closer look at Akamai's business and see
what CAPS investors are saying about the stock right now.

Akamai facts


Headquarters (Founded)
 

Cambridge, Mass. (1998)

Trailing-12-Month Revenue
 

$1.09 billion


Management
 

CEO Paul Sagan (since 2005)

CFO J.D. Sherman (since 2006)

Cash/Debt
 

$497.2 million / $0


Competitors
 

AT&T (NYSE: T &nbsp;)

Limelight Networks (Nasdaq: LLNW &nbsp;)

Level 3 Communications (Nasdaq: LVLT &nbsp;)


Sources: Capital IQ (a division of Standard & Poor's) and Motley Fool
CAPS.

On CAPS, 96% of the 3,353 members who have rated Akamai believe the stock
will outperform the S&P 500 going forward. These bulls include beadnell
and fellow Fool Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong).

Just last week, beadnell tapped Akamai as a cheap way to go for growth:
"The P/E is no longer stratospheric. Web video is only going to grow, so
a rising tide will float all content delivery networks."

Akamai even boasts a robust three-year average operating margin of 28.7%.
That's higher than that of rival AT&T (17%), let alone Limelight and
Level 3, which sport a negative average operating margin of -17.1% and
-0.4%, respectively.Ã‚Â 

Sean Williams expands on the outperform argument:

I personally added Akamai to my own portfolio ... after the company
guided earnings down yet again. Consolidation hype is on the rise and the
company continues to pace itself at a 13% growth rate, nothing to sneeze
at with a forward P/E of also 13. If you want more of my thoughts on
AKAM, you can check them out here.
