Coldwater Creek Makes Splash With First TV Ad Campaign



National Campaign From DeVito/Verdi Targets Women Of A Certain Age; Ads
Celebrate Those Who "Still Got It"
















NEW YORK, Sept. 6, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Long overlooked in
fashion and apparel advertising, today's mature woman finally gets a star
turn in a series of new television commercials from Coldwater Creek,
marking the retailer's first dive into TV advertising on a national level.

Celebrating the look, style and sex appeal of women of a certain age, the
seven new commercials from Coldwater Creek target the 45+-year-old
shopper with a smart, playful and confident message that captures the
essence of the brand's shopper.

The campaign was created by the New York advertising agency DeVito/Verdi,
which was named Coldwater Creek's first advertising agency of record
earlier this year. The campaign will begin airing immediately after Labor
Day and will run throughout the holiday season.

The first commercial shows a woman deliberating over which dress to wear
while her date for the evening waits somewhat patiently downstairs. As
she re-thinks her choice and opts for another dress, new earrings and a
scarf, the voiceover asks: "Did they ask Michelangelo what was taking so
long with the ceiling? Did an impatient publisher tell Tolstoy that the
War part was so good, he didn't need the Peace? Did someone tell
Beethoven, 'It's just a symphony, you should have been finished weeks
ago'? So just tell him you'll be ready when you're ready."

"Our customer makes a concerted effort every day to put herself together.
She is conscious of being age-appropriate; not too old or too young. Our
customer is looking for outfits that are stylish, vibrant and flattering.
She wants her wardrobe to be versatile and reflect current fashion, while
at the same time be age appropriate," said Tim Dilworth, senior vice
president of marketing at Coldwater Creek. "She likes clothing that fits
her and shows off her features that she considers an asset. This campaign
works to give new resonance to Coldwater Creek and feature our exciting
new fall line. This campaign is designed to elevate and change the
brand's perception while introducing Coldwater Creek as a more modern and
sophisticated destination."

Other spots include a woman returning to her high school reunion where
she receives an array of compliments and an uncomfortably long hug from
an old classmate who is actually trying to read the Coldwater Creek label
on her well-dressed friend's cocktail dress. Another commercial looks at
a girls' night out and the subtext of sartorial competition even among
life-long friends.

A fourth commercial follows a confident and stylish woman who would
"never just throw something on," no matter how casual the activity. And
another spot shows a woman shopping with the assistance of a department
store saleswoman. When asked where she bought her attractive jacket, the
saleswoman looks around the store to make sure no one is listening, and
leans in to whisper where, as the super appears with the answer:
"Coldwater Creek."

"Emotionally, our target shopper embraces the changes that come with her
age, while still looking for silhouettes that reflect her updated fashion
sensibility and give her shape. She positively focuses on ways to
capitalize on her beauty. What drives her is the feeling that 'she's
still got IT,'" said Theresa Renaud, account director at DeVito/Verdi.
"Not only does she choose products that help her communicate her
vitality, she thrives on the flattery that comes with her success. The
narratives in this campaign subtly touch upon these truths."
