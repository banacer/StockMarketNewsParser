While the markets came off the day's lows during the closing hours, they
were unable to move into the positive and as a consequence, indices in
the Indian stock market closed the first day of the week on a negative
note. The BSE-Sensex edged lower by around 110 points whereas NSE-Nifty
was seen shedding close to 20 points (down 0.45%). The BSE Mid Cap and
BSE Small Cap indices bucked the trend though and closed marginally
higher today. Two stocks declined for every one that gained on the Sensex
today.

While most Asian indices also closed in the red today, Europe too is
witnessing a negative trend currently. The rupee was seen trading at Rs
45.95 to the dollar at the time of writing.

By closing in the negative today, the markets broke last week's winning
streak whereby the Sensex went up to the tune of 6%. The indices traded
weak right from the beginning today and did not cross the breakeven point
even once. The reason the markets fell today could be find out from the
fate of export oriented stocks. With the same suffering significant
reverses, it could be argued that economic growth in the West has once
again come under question. With the US economy failing to add any new
jobs in August, recession worries came to the fore yet again and this led
investors to dump Indian stocks that get a good part of their revenues
from abroad. All eyes are now on the speech by US President Obama
scheduled this Thursday where he is expected to unveil a new fiscal plan.

Two wheeler stocks like Hero Motocorp, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor defied
the overall market trend and closed strong today. In fact, Bajaj Auto,
India's second largest two-wheeler player closed at its life time high.
The buoyancy in the two-wheeler counters could be attributed to the
continued strong growth in sales despite an adverse interest rate
environment. Furthermore, the fact that commodity prices have trended
down in recent times is also likely to be a big positive for these
players. It should be noted that despite growing strongly, two wheeler
penetration in India is on the lower side and hence, demand should
continue to remain strong for few more years to come. Also, the fact that
companies like Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor have been successful in making
their mark in the exports markets is also adding to the allure towards
sector stocks.

As per a leading daily, Tata Steel, India's largest steel manufacturer is
likely to set up a new steel tubes manufacturing and processing facility
at its Zwijndrecht plant in the Netherlands to cater to the automotive
sector. The supply of specialised chassis parts, normalised, cut to
length high strength steel tubes for lightweight structural use in
vehicles will be the main targets of this facility. This investment will
make the company a fully integrated tubes supplier for the auto sector,
in control of the complete value chain, right from steel production to
production, normalising, cutting and packing of tubes. The stock closed
higher on the bourses today along with SAIL and Jindal Steel.
