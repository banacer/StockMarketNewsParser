Zacks Investment Research is one of the most highly regarded firms in the
investment industry. The guiding principle behind our work is that there
must be a good reason for brokerage firms to spend billions of dollars a
year on stock research. Obviously, these investment experts know
something special that may be indicative of the future direction of stock
prices. From day one, we were determined to unlock that secret knowledge
and make it available to our clients to help them improve their
investment results.
