Campaign supports brand’s increased commitment to mobile product offerings


DALLAS, Sept. 6, 2011 /PRNewswire/ — Today, hotels.comÃ‚Â® launched an
exciting, “extreme” campaign centered on the company’s Ã‚Â high-speed
mobile booking application, which allows users to book rooms at its
network of almost 140,000 worldwide hotels. Ã‚Â To promote the idea that
you can easily and quickly book a hotel room from almost anywhere, even
at the very last minute, hotels.com has teamed up with extreme athlete
and stuntman, JT Holmes, Ã‚Â for a wild and exciting digital
demonstration to prove just how easy it is to book a room while ‘on the
fly&#8217;.Ã‚Â

“The hotels.com mobile booking application is so fast, you can book in a
freefall…” is the story being told in the digital video piece with JT
Holmes. The video features the world-renowned skydiver booking a hotel
room while flying at over 115 miles per hour in a 15,000 foot freefall
before landing on the Lake Tahoe beach of the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe
Resort, Spa &amp; Casino. The stunt, performed by Holmes is actually a
live-action version of an animated television commercial, produced by
hotels.com, in which claymated characters also book a hotel room while on
a skydiving vacation.

As the use of mobile devices as consumer travel tools increase,
hotels.com continues to launch new applications with sophisticated
functionality. Ã‚Â This particular campaign, supported by a full 360
marketing effort, included display ads, social media activation, and the
www.thesmarterapp.com microsite, in addition to the digital video and
claymation commercial.

The hotels.com mobile booking app, which is available for iPhone and
Android, features specialized offers, including exclusive mobile deals
and over 20,000 last minute deals. Ã‚Â It is available in more than 30
languages in more than 70 countries, and can access past and future
reservations, even when offline. Ã‚Â Mobile GPS functionality will allow
the app to find the closest hotels with the best deals, based on a user’s
current location. WelcomerewardsÃ‚Â® loyalty points can also be tracked
and redeemed through the app.

“Our customers are increasingly relying on mobile devices to play, work,
shop and book travel while on-the-go. We want to offer them the quickest,
most seamless way to take care of travel while actually travelling,” said
Vic Walia, senior director of North America brand marketing. “The
hotels.com mobile booking app helps our customers to make fast
last-minute bookings, allowing them to create a malleable travel
itinerary, open to last-minute changes.”

Over one million hotels.com mobile apps have been downloaded for iPhone
and Android since the original launch of both products. Ã‚Â Additional
mobile extensions, including an iPad booking app, are planned for the
near future.
