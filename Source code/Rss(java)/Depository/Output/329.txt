Enhanced Hosted Telepresence for Cisco Users, from Glowpoint


Glowpoint, providers of cloud-based video conferencing solutions, have
enhanced their managed video services for users of Cisco Systems’
telepresence equipment, including a hosted Cisco telepresence
infrastructure, the Cisco TelePresence Video Communications Server (VCS),
the Video Communications Expressway, the TelePresence Server MSE 8710,
and the Cisco TelePresence Movi for mobile telepresence.

The new hosted infrastructure provides Cisco TelePresence with a
flexible, and more affordable, way of expanding video coverage for remote
and home office workers, without the need to purchase and install new
hardware for each location. Interoperability is supported by Glowpoint
through the Telepresence Interoperability Protocol, thereby enabling a
managed unified communications gateway based on the Cisco VCS. The
gateway links telepresence systems with unified communications
applications from Cisco, Avaya, Microsoft and other providers.

Essentially there are three new enhancements to the cloud-managed video
service for Cisco telepresence customers:

• Hosted Cisco telepresence infrastructure .
• Enhanced telepresence interoperability with support for TIP.
• Managed unified communications (UC) gateway solution, including support
for Microsoft Lync.

Stephen Vobbe, Senior Vice President of Sales & Marketing at Glowpoint,
said, “Expanding our cloud-managed video services for Cisco customers
continues to be a top priority. Telepresence and video conferencing
customers continue to ask for increased interoperability and support for
mobile desktop and unified communications applications delivered as a
cloud service. We are delivering that with these new enhancements.”

Glowpoint’s cloud-managed video services includes a secure, redundant and
easily accessible mix of hardware, software and support services
including:

• Web-based video management portal.
• Exchange and Notes integrated scheduling and call launching.
• 24x7 remote monitoring, diagnostics and help desk.
• Telepresence and video conferencing interoperability.
• Complete business-to-business exchange access.
• Multiple MCU bridges, gateways, gatekeepers and call routing technology.
• On demand and managed bridging services, with language translation and
webcasting.

Using Glowpoint’s cloud managed video services, enterprises can
potentially reduce costs and improve productivity.
Randy Harrell, Director of Product Marketing at Cisco, commented, “Our
immersive solutions continue to deliver a consistent and powerful
in-person experience that exceeds customer expectations leading to
increased usage. Cloud managed services that ensure the highest level
uptime and meeting quality for our solutions are a key component to our
continued growth in the marketplace and the adoption of the technology.”

Darren Podrabsky, Vice President of Marketing & Channels at Glowpoint,
added, “Because deploying and managing video requires specific expertise,
the IT team that supports video with an enterprise is often separated
from the team managing the other unified communications applications. Our
UC gateway solution delivered as a cloud managed video service
effectively bridges that gap and enables companies to easily and
confidently connect video with other unified communications applications.”

The new enhanced services for Cisco unified communications solutions are
available from Glowpoint or qualified partners, delivered via Glowpoint’s
OpenVideo™ architecture, a collection of technologies and processes that
provide flexible, high quality, reliable cloud managed video services
across a wide range of video endpoint solutions.
