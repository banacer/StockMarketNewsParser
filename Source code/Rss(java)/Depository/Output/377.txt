Altera Releases Industry's First 28-nm FPGA Development Kit



Full-Featured Stratix V GX FPGA-Based Development Kit Accelerates the
Development of High-Bandwidth Systems
















SAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 6, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Altera
Corporation today reached another milestone in driving the industry's
rollout of 28-nm FPGAs by announcing availability of the StratixÃ‚Â® V GX
FPGA Signal Integrity Development Kit, the first development kit
featuring 28-nm FPGAs. This full-featured kit allows design engineers to
accelerate the design and development of high-performance systems that
meet the industry's demand for more bandwidth. The Stratix V GX FPGA
Signal Integrity Development Kit provides customers a platform for
measuring and evaluating transceiver link performance ranging from 600
Mbps to 12.5 Gbps.







The Stratix V GX FPGA Signal Integrity Development Kit features advanced
equalization functions for the device's high-speed serial transceivers.
Customers can perform real-world system analysis using on-board SMA and
popular backplane connectors including MolexÃ‚Â® ImpactÃ‚Â® and
AmphenolÃ‚Â® XCedeÃ‚Â®. These built in high-speed backplane connectors
are used to evaluate custom backplane performance and evaluate link BER.
Users can also generate and check pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS)
patterns via an easy to use graphical user interface.

"To meet the ever increasing data rates and bandwidth requirements of
today's high-end communications systems, it's essential for SERDES
providers to invest in signal and power integrity in their silicon," said
Dr. Eric Bogatin, Signal Integrity Evangelist with Bogatin Enterprises, a
LeCroy Company. "Altera's Stratix V Transceiver Signal Integrity
Development Kit provides an ideal vehicle to evaluate transceiver
performance for customer applications and accelerate the development time
for new designs."

The Stratix V FPGA Signal Integrity Development Kit allows users to
verify compliance with the most popular protocol standards today,
including 10GbE, 10GBASE-KR, PCI ExpressÃ‚Â® (PCIeÃ‚Â®) Gen1, Gen2 and
Gen3, Serial RapidIOÃ‚Â®, Gigabit Ethernet (GbE), 10 GbE XAUI, CEI-6G,
CEI-11G, HD-SDI, Interlaken and Fiber Channel. The development kit
features a Stratix V GX FPGA-based development board, a one-year license
of QuartusÃ‚Â® II Software, design examples and access to Altera's
MegaCoreÃ‚Â® IP library including the NiosÃ‚Â® II Embedded Design Suite.

Pricing and Availability

The Stratix V GX FPGA Signal Integrity Development Kit is available now
and priced at $4,995. To learn more about this kit, or to purchase, visit
