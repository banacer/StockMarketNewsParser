Datacentre services provider Equinix is working with the Ministry of
Defence (MOD) to recruit staff who have left the armed forces.

News of the initiative follows last week's announcement about armed
forces job cuts, which could see up to 1,000 RAF and army personnel being
made redundant.

Equinix, which has datacentres in the UK, Netherlands and US, said the
scheme was the result of a successful work experience placement involving
former armed forces team leader Wayne Ginders.

Speaking to ChannelWeb, Russell Poole, UK managing director at Equinix,
explained: "We were contacted by Wayne when he left the army about the
possibility of doing work experience with us.

"We offered him a six-month placement and, within two months of him
starting work, we offered him a permanent position."

The firm will use the scheme to recruit customer support engineers and
fill positions in its mechanical and electrical teams.

"One of the reasons we are doing this is because it puts the company in a
light that we would like to be seen in," explained Poole. "Also, this is
going to give us a competitive advantage because of how highly trained
people who work in the armed forces are."

Equinix has also launched an apprenticeship scheme to offer on-the-job
training to school leavers. Its first two participants will start work at
Equinix next week.

"There are lots of people who leave school after completing their GCSEs
or A-levels who do not want to go into higher education, to whom we can
offer career development opportunities," said Poole.

"If it is successful Ã¢Â€Â“ and there is no reason so suggest it will not
be Ã¢Â€Â“ we will open it up to more candidates," he added.
