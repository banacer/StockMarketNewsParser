MTPV, LLC, a clean energy semiconductor chip company, announced today
that it raised $6.5 million in the initial closing of its series B
financing. The round, which was led by pre-existing investor Spinnaker
Capital, LLC of Boston, included an investment from Applied Ventures,
LLC, the venture capital arm of Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT).
Also investing in the series B financing were the Massachusetts Clean
Energy Center, Austin-based Ensys Capital, LLC, and several existing MTPV
investors.

MTPV creates semiconductor chips that convert heat directly into
electricity. Similar to a solar panel that converts sunlight into
electricity, MTPV chips are able to convert any source of heat into
electricity with breakthrough efficiency and power.

“MTPV represents an intersection between the semiconductor and energy
worlds, two large markets that align well with Applied Materials’ core
expertise,” said J. Christopher Moran, Corporate Vice President and
General Manager of Applied Ventures. “We are pleased that this investment
will be used to support the development of products for making
alternative energy and environmental solutions more accessible and
affordable.”

The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC), also a Series B investor
in MTPV, has been a long- time supporter of the company. “MassCEC is
dedicated to accelerating the success of clean energy development and
implementation while creating high-quality jobs and long-term economic
growth in Massachusetts,” said Patrick Clooney MassCEC’s Executive
Director. “Helping companies like MTPV take another step closer to
commercialization will not only benefit our local economy, it will bring
a valuable and important energy choice to the world.”

Bob DiMatteo, MTPV’s CEO, founded MTPV after the original breakthrough
research at MIT. Since then, MTPV has added many patents to its credit,
scaled the technology, and is now beta testing its first commercial
prototypes. “Attracting new investors to our venture is a wonderful
validation of the team’s hard work,” said DiMatteo. “We are also
fortunate to have a very dedicated set of existing investors that
continue to believe in the team and our promise for success.”

MTPV expects to complete the financing by selling an additional $2
million in equity within the next few months. The company will use the
funds from the Series B financing to expand its current beta testing and
scale its manufacturing capabilities.
