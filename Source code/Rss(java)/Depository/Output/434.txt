6 September 11 16:43, Globes' correspondent

Ampal-American Israel Corporation (Nasdaq: AMPL; TASE:AMPL) has fired
director Dr. Nimrod Novik, effective immediately, over a breach of
fiduciary duties to the company and its shareholders based on various
acts and omissions.

Ampal's board of directors found that Novik threatened, solely for
personal gain, to damage the company in a separate dispute (to which the
company is not a party) with Ampal president and CEO Yosef Maiman. Ampal
added that it will use all appropriate legal measures required to protect
the company from any damage caused or that will be caused by Novik and to
fully recover any damages from him.

Ampal's share price fell 2.5% on the TASE today to NIS 1.59, and will
open at $0.47 on Nasdaq, giving a market cap of $26.4m
