TECH STOCKS: Techs Join Broad Market Retreat




By Benjamin Pimentel, MarketWatch

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Technology stocks headed south Tuesday,
swept down in a broad market sell-off sparked by financial worries in
Europe, and J.P. Morgan warnings on the personal computer and software
markets.

The Nasdaq Composite Index (RIXF) fell 2.1% to 2,428 in early trading, as
the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) lost 250 points. The Morgan
Stanley High Tech 35(MSH) Index and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index
(SOX) were each down more than 2%.

Shares of Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) fell nearly 6% to become one of the top
Dow component decliners.

Dell Inc. (DELL) also saw its shares fall 1.6%, as J.P. Morgan analyst
Mark Moskowitz warned of "sustained weakness" in PC shipments to Europe
and the U.S.

"Our research indicates that softness manifested in late July and has not
abated," Moskowitz wrote. "Meanwhile, China and Latin America have been
bright spots, but these regions are not large enough to counter EMEA and
U.S. weakness."

The software sector also took a hit, as shares of Oracle Corp. (ORCL)
fell 3.4%, while Microsoft Corp.(MSFT) 2.5%. VMware (VMW) sank 3.4%,
while Salesforce.com (CRM) traded down 4.5%.

J.P. Morgan analyst John DiFucci warned of softening demand in the
corporate technology market, due to the economic worries both in Europe
and the U.S.

"We believe that corporate IT demand will continue to soften in the
European region over the next several quarters, compounded by net
negative contribution from U.S. government and financial services," he
wrote.
