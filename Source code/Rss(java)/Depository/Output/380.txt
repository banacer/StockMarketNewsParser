Sep 06, 2011 (SmarTrend(R) News Watch via COMTEX) -- Below are the top
five companies in the Biotechnology industry as measured by their Debt to
EBITDA ratio.

The measure of a debt's pay-back period is Debt/EBITDA. The longer the
payback period, the greater the risk. This metric ignores all tax
expenses even though a good portion are cash payments and gets paid first.

NPS Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:NPSP - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA
ratio of 57.39x based on total debt of $252.4 million.

BioMarin Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ:BMRN - Analyst Report) has a Debt/EBITDA
ratio of 12.32x based on total debt of $377.5 million.

Neurocrine Biosciences (NASDAQ:NBIX - Analyst Report) has a Debt/EBITDA
ratio of 4.24x based on total debt of $38.7 million.

Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN - Analyst Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.2x
based on total debt of $13.9 billion.

Cubist Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:CBST - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA
ratio of 2.06x based on total debt of $444.9 million.

SmarTrend currently has shares of Neurocrine Biosciences in an Downtrend
and issued the Downtrend alert on August 04, 2011 at $6.90. The stock has
fallen 15.8% since the Downtrend alert was issued.
