US stocks are again likely to open low today on renewed euro zone debt
concerns just underlining the fact that absolutely nothing is for sure
and permanent in this market. The recovery was fragile and short lived
and markets are again headed for lower levels. However, China
Infrastructure Investment Corp (NASDAQ: CIIC), Agria Corporation (ADR)
(NYSE: GRO) and Mecox Lane Limited (ADR) (NASDAQ: MCOX) are only looking
up defying all the concepts of gravity of Ã¢Â€Â˜everything that goes up
comes downÃ¢Â€Â™.

The unusual aspect in these stocksÃ¢Â€Â™ rally is the extraordinary
volume gains they have recorded in the past few days. All of the
companies are based in China so there is an emerging market factor
contributing to the meteoric rise.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

China Infrastructure Investment Corp (NASDAQ: CIIC) recorded gains of
almost 150 per cent in the past week on hectic buying by retail and big
investors. The stock registered unusual volumes of up to 5 times of their
monthly averages. It currently trades on the higher side of its 52 week
range of $0.20 - $1.05. This is very uncharacteristic of this stock which
has remained somewhat out of the analystsÃ¢Â€Â™ eyes primarily because of
the poor outlook of construction and infrastructure space in the country.
However, announcements of corporate developments pertaining to related
party loans have increased the hopes of a turnaround in this company.

Beijing based agriculture firm Agria Corporation (ADR) (NYSE: GRO) closed
the week with 46 per cent gains. Even after weekly gains, the stock
gained tremendously on Friday towards the end of the session indicating
strong buyer interest with very high volumes. It may open high today and
could possibly be subject to profit taking during the day. However, it
has clearly got the momentum capable of catapulting to higher levels.
This high beta stock has a 52 week range of $0.63 - $2.12 Ã‚Â Ã‚Â and
currently trades at $1.49.

Ã‚Â Shanghai based retailer Mecox Lane Limited (ADR) (NASDAQ: MCOX) also
made smart advances of 65 per cent during the week on hopes of the
company posting better than expected numbers in its quarterly results
today. There is increased optimism from the company after the
disappointing results in the March quarter, though it remains a
profitable entity on annual basis. Despite the recent gains, the stock
has lost more than half of its value in the past 6 months. This is a
fundamentally good business model with reasonable valuations. Ã‚Â
