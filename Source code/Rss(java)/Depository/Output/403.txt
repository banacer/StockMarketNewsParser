Sep 06, 2011 (SmarTrend(R) News Watch via COMTEX) -- Below are the top
five companies in the Oil & Gas Exploration & Production industry as
measured by their Debt to EBITDA ratio.

The measure of a debt's pay-back period is Debt/EBITDA. The longer the
payback period, the greater the risk. This metric ignores all tax
expenses even though a good portion are cash payments and gets paid first.

Penn Virginia (NYSE:PVA - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio of
8.75x based on total debt of $597.7 million.

GeoMet (NASDAQ:GMET - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio of 8.12x
based on total debt of $79.8 million.

Carrizo Oil & Gas (NASDAQ:CRZO - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio
of 6.03x based on total debt of $607 million.

Linn Energy (NASDAQ:LINE - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio of
5.58x based on total debt of $3.1 billion.

ATP Oil & Gas (NASDAQ:ATPG - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio of
5.44x based on total debt of $2 billion.

SmarTrend currently has shares of Penn Virginia in an Downtrend and
issued the Downtrend alert on June 29, 2011 at $13.47. The stock has
fallen 46.8% since the Downtrend alert was issued.
