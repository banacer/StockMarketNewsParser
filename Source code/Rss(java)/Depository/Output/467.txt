Reliance Globalcom Upgrades Asia Submarine Cable Network with
CienaÃ¢Â€Â™s Coherent 40G Technology

Written by TradersHuddle Staff   
Tuesday, 06 September 2011 09:07
LINTHICUM, Md.-( Business Wire )-

Ciena® Corporation (NASDAQ: CIEN), the network specialist, today
announced that Reliance Globalcom, the leading global provider of managed
network and communication services for multinational enterprises and
carriers, completed an upgrade of its FNAL submarine network with Ciena’s
market-leading coherent 40G optical networking solution. The first
coherent 40G submarine network in Asia, Reliance Globalcom’s enhanced
network brings massive capacity increases to two key routes that each
span approximately 5,000 kilometers to connect Japan, Taiwan, South Korea
and Hong Kong.

Key Facts:

* Reliance Globalcom owns one of the world’s largest private undersea
  cable systems that spans a total of 65,000 kilometers. When combined
  with the 190,000 kilometers of domestic fiber of its parent company,
  Reliance Communications, the global network connects 40 key business
  markets across India, the Middle East, Asia, Europe and the United
  States.
* Powered by Ciena’s industry-leading WaveLogic™ coherent optical
  processors, the upgraded submarine cable network will add a total of
  four terabits per second (Tbps) of capacity and lay the foundation for
  a path to 100G in the near future.
* Ciena provided Reliance Globalcom its 6500 Packet-Optical Platform
  with 40G ultra long haul interfaces, which are designed to
  significantly increase submarine network capacity without disrupting
  existing customer traffic or adding cost and complexity to the network.
* Ciena also provided Deployment Services and quickly turned up the
  system with in-service traffic migration from existing 10G to coherent
  40G. To ensure optimal network performance, Reliance Globalcomm is also
  utilizing Ciena’s network management software solutions.
* This upgrade is also believed to be the first submarine deployment
  with reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADM), which
  provide flexibility to add or drop select wavelengths at intermediate
  sites. In addition to reducing latency on the route, this gives
  Reliance Globalcom the ability to quickly react to changing traffic
  demands and increase network availability.
* This deployment builds on a long-standing relationship between Ciena
  and Reliance Globalcom and its parent company Reliance Communications.
  Earlier this year, the companies announced a separate 40G ultra long
  haul deployment on the Reliance Globalcom network to support a 6,400
  kilometer submarine link connecting the UK, Spain, Italy and Egypt.
* More recently, Reliance Communications leveraged Ciena’s coherent 40G
  solutions to support an upgrade of its nationwide long-haul network in
  India. The enhanced backbone infrastructure offers higher capacities
  and improved scale to support the Reliance Communications’ wireless and
  wireline broadband initiatives, including the delivery of its recently
  launched 3G services.

Executive Quotes:

“Ciena’s solution enables us to provide four times the bandwidth with a
simple card upgrade, removing the need for costly and complex
infrastructure changes,” said Rory Cole, COO Carrier Business at Reliance
Globalcom. “We have a fantastic partnership with Ciena and have been
impressed by their optical technology leadership, the success of our
recent trial activities and their long-standing relationship with our
parent company. We chose Ciena because of their demonstrable track record
in helping service providers to deliver innovative and highly reliable
communications services.”

“We’re pleased to support Reliance Globalcom in deploying Asia’s first
high-capacity submarine network with ROADM functionality, which provides
greater flexibility to route traffic quickly and more effectively address
changing traffic demands,” said Ed McCormack, vice president and general
manager of international accounts and submarine systems at Ciena.
“Ciena’s submarine solutions are vital for leading providers like
Reliance Globalcom which are focused on increasing network capacity
without disrupting existing customer traffic or adding cost and
complexity to the network.”

Technology Leadership and Product Background:

* Ciena's WaveLogic coherent optical processors enable operators to
  maximize the reach, capacity and flexibility of submarine networks with
  a focus on ease-of-deployment, cost efficiency and network investment
  protection. Using innovative coherent receiver and dual polarization
  phase shift key (DP PSK) modulation technology, Ciena’s technology
  enables seamless upgrades to 40G/100G on submarine networks with only
  the addition of new terminal equipment, significantly extending the
  life of existing cable plants.
* The pioneer in coherent optical technology, Ciena is also the market
  leader in this area, with more than 8500 coherent 40G/100G line
  interfaces shipped to more than 80 customers across the globe,
  including deployments in eight countries across the Asia Pacific region.
* With the ability to be deployed over any existing line system,
  Ciena's 6500 supports both 40G and 100G coherent transmission with more
  than 7.8 million coherent kilometers deployed.
