Pre-Market Update Ã¢Â€Â“ Gapping Stocks ( SBUX, BAC, C, BIDU, NFLX )

New York, Sep 6th (TradersHuddle.com) Ã¢Â€Â“ US stock futures were
pointing for a lower open early Tuesday morning as investors return from
the long holiday weekend. Futures have traded off their lows, as European
shares are trading higher, however the overseas sell-off that
materialized on Monday is still weighing sentiment.

Europe's sovereign debt issues are worsening and might trigger a second
financial crisis, which in conjunction with the global growth concerns is
creating the negative down draft for the markets. The decision for the
Swiss National Bank to intervene to stop the appreciation of the Franc
sent both the Euro and the Dollar higher.

Here are some notable stocks in pre-market action.

Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is trading lower in pre-market action in concert
with the overall market weakness. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s being reported that Starbucks
is planning a big expansion in China, as the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s Asian
President announced that they plan to reach 1,500 coffee shops. Starbucks
currently operates 470 establishments in China. Starbucks stock price
action has so far hold the 200 day moving average in two separate
occasions earlier last Month, having support defined at $35.50 area.

The financial sector will be on the spotlight once again as the concerns
over Europe continue to grow and the mortgage lending crisis backslash
continue affecting the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s big banks. Last Friday, the Federal
Housing Finance Agency's (FHFA) presented a lawsuits against 17 large
banks, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C). In
the case of Bank of America the pain and negative headlines continue to
haunt the stock that in todayÃ¢Â€Â™s pre-market is attempting to hold the
$7 level. Bank of America previous $8.5 billion settlement of Countrywide
mortgage putback claims is now being contested by U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)
and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) among others.

Citigroup on the other hand is also probing previous lows with the stock
already down at the $27 level, considering that the stock was trading
above $50 back in January that is close to a 50% drop year to date.

Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) will be opening lower this morning below its 50 day
moving average following the market sell-off in Asia. Baidu stock, so far
has been able to hold the 200 day moving average, but concerns that it
was not able to break into new highs my put a stop in the stock positive
momentum for the time being. Baidu stock was sold off initially during
the month of August on reaction to a report alleging fraudulent sites in
its search results.

Lastly, letÃ¢Â€Â™s look at Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) that is actually trading
flat in this morning pre-market. Netflix gapped lower last Friday on news
that Starz ended contract renewal negotiations and will pull its movies
and TV shows from Netflix early next year. Starz content is a
considerable component of Netflix streaming offering, so any impact there
will definitely result in a reduction in the available titles, which will
not be receive well on subscribers that have recently suffered price
hikes. . The possibility of spiking streaming content costs have been
haunting the stock since early July, when analysts started to warn that
Netflix explosive growth as the company raised prices to alleviate
raising streaming content costs.
