Darwin Effect Cuts Photovoltaic Prices, Abound Solar Says

Sep 6th, 2011 | By Editor | Category: Latest Headlines

Excerpt from an article in Bloomberg: Abound Solar Inc., the
photovoltaic- panel maker using technology favored by General Electric
Co. (GE) and First Solar Inc. (FSLR) of the U.S., said bankruptcies that
are culling higher-cost rivals will help cut module prices to $1 a watt.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThis is Darwinism at work in business,Ã¢Â€Â Julian Hawkins, senior
vice president of sales and marketing at the closely held U.S.
manufacturer, said in a telephone interview. Ã¢Â€ÂœItÃ¢Â€Â™s probably a
good thing in the long run.Ã¢Â€Â

Solyndra Inc. on Aug. 31 became the third U.S. solar- equipment maker to
fail in a month as declining panel prices and a slowdown in global demand
forced weaker companies to team with competitors or close shop.
Competitors were basing their businesses on the assumption they could
sell panels at $2 per watt or more, which was unsustainable, Hawkins said.
