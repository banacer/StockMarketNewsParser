UK's Nice Rejects Three Drugs For Metastic Colorectal Cancer




LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The U.K.'s healthcare costs watchdog Monday said in
draft guidance that it was not recommending Merck KGaA's (MRK.XE)
Erbitux, Roche Holding AG's (ROG.VX) Avastin, and Amgen's (AMGN) Vectibix
for treating patients having metastatic colorectal cancer that has
progressed after first line chemotherapy.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, or NICE, which
decides what medicines should be used on Britain's publicly funded
National Health Service said the three drug--whose chemical names are
cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab respectively--did not represent
value for money.

Andrew Dillon, chief executive of NICE said in a statement, "Metastatic
colorectal cancer is when the primary cancer has spread from the colon or
rectum to other parts of the body, such as the liver."

"We have already recommended six treatments for various stages of
colorectal cancer and are disappointed not to be able to recommend
cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab for this stage, but we have to be
confident that the benefits justify the cost of the drugs."

"At present, the independent appraisal committee who drafted the
recommendations does not feel it has enough clear evidence, especially in
the case of bevacizumab, to be able to recommend these drugs for use on
the NHS," Dillon said.

NICE said its preliminary decision is open to consultation.

"It is also possible for the manufacturers to provide further comment on
the committee's interpretation of their products' clinical effectiveness
or consider reducing the price they are asking the NHS to pay through a
patient access scheme," it added. --By Sten Stovall, Dow Jones Newswires;
