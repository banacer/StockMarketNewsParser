Follow this company has received $63.5 million in new capital from the
federal Small Business Lending Fund program, according to an announcement.

The Montgomery County-based First Bancorp (NASDAQ: FBNC) said it has also
redeemed the $65 million worth of shares of preferred stock it issued to
the federal government in 2009 under the Troubled Asset Relief Program or
TARP.

The Small Business Lending Fund is aimed at encouraging healthy community
banks to increase their lending to small businesses. Dividends on the
stock issued under that program start out at 5 percent but fall as low as
1 percent depending on how well the bank does at meeting loan growth
targets, making the SBLF capital less expensive than TARP money.

CEO Jerry Ocheltree said he's pleased to be taking part in the new
program.

"We believe our participation in the SBLF program is a great opportunity
for our company and enhances our ability to meet the credit needs of the
small business community in our various markets," he said.
