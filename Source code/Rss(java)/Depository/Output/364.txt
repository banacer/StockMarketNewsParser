AEterna Zentaris and AVI BioPharma Maintain Steady Pipelines



The Bedford Report Provides Equity Research on AEterna Zentaris & AVI
BioPharma
















NEW YORK, NY, Sep 06, 2011 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) -- The importance of
maintaining a steady pipeline of drugs to market is having varied effects
on the biotechnology industry. Analysis by the professional services firm
BDO argues that larger Pharmaceutical firms are increasing reliance on
biotech companies to fill its pipeline, which has been a net positive for
small biotech companies. The Bedford Report examines the outlook for
companies in the biotechnology industry and provides investment research
on AEterna Zentaris, Inc. and AVI BioPharma, Inc. . Access to the full
company reports can be found at:

www.bedfordreport.com/AEZS

While the positive fundamentals are there, last month biotech stocks
suffered from what MarketWatch's Val Brickates Kennedy calls the
"Dendreon Effect." The article reports that biotech companies whose
stocks have taken heavy hits include those that are at early stages of
marketing new treatments.

"Pretty much every company that had just launched a product or was about
to launch a product got crushed," Leerink Swann analyst Howard Liang
explains.
