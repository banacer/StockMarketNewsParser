RIVERSIDE, Calif., (MMD Newswire) September 06, 2011 - - Isobaric
Strategies Inc (ISOBARIX), today announced that its first commercial
installation of the XPR (aXle Position Rotor) product line of isobaric
energy recovery devices has been in operation for 24 weeks without any
incidents.

The XPR technology offers 60 - 100 % more flow per similar sized unit
compared to current market leading technology offered by Energy Recovery,
Inc (NASDAQ: ERII). The product line offers unit flows of up to 500 GPM
SWRO and 300 GPM BWRO and utilizes a proprietary pressure vessel in
Titanium or 316 L compatible with common feed sources, including
processing liquids used in the gas and oil industry.



In response to considerable interest in acquiring firsthand experience
with the technology, ISOBARIX is launching a retrofit unit for existing
PX-65 series of Energy Recovery Inc. The PXCM (PX Converter Module)
cartridge is an internal unit that seamlessly fits inside the pressure
vessel of any PX-180, 220 or 260 and offers higher efficiency, less
mixing and extended flow range up to 350 GPM.

"Contrary to uncertain new SWRO market growth projections, the existing
world-wide ERD's will have to be maintained in operation throughout the
lifetime of the desalination plant and represent a considerable retrofit
market potential" asserts Leif J. Hauge, President and CEO of ISOBARIX.

"Our expectation to the new XPR device has been completely fulfilled and
we are ready to start retrofitting our second SWRO train this fall",
stated Martin A. Lindberg, Operational Manager at the desalination plant
at AvedÃ¸re Unit 2 power station operated by DONG Energy AS in
Copenhagen, Denmark. The advanced power plant use a variety of fuels,
including natural gas, oil, straw and wood pellets and needfresh water
for boiler feed and district heating and operates at an exceptional
energy utilization of up to 94%.
