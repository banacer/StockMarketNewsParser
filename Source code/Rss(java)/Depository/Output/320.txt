Thai petrochemical manufacturer leverages Ariba solutions to streamline
processes and drive savings across organization

Sunnyvale, CA Ã¢Â€Â“ Within many organizations, procurement is still a
largely manual process. But not at PTT Chemical Public Company Ltd., a
fully integrated chemical manufacturer whose core products include
ethylene, propylene, and polymer resins. That's because the company has
implemented solutions from Ariba, Inc., the leading provider of
collaborative business commerce solutions, to take things online and fuel
a competitive, best-in-class process for sourcing goods and services that
delivers savings and efficiencies across its operations.

"Procurement tends to be a time and effort-intensive process, especially
for PTT Chemical where we structured Procurement as a Shared-Service
unit. We procured all goods and services upon requisitions from all
companies under our Group" said Khun Wilawan Songjaroen, Vice President
of Procurement and Contract Management, PTT Chemical. "But we realized
that by introducing e-procurement, we could standardize our processes,
minimize processing time, reduce transaction costs and improve contract
compliance."

And to do it, PTT Chemical has implemented a range of Ariba solutions,
including: Ariba Sourcing, Ariba Contract Management and Ariba Buyer.
With Ariba's technology in place, PTT Chemical has enabled a standard
online sourcing process through which it can more efficiently negotiate
best-value agreements and a catalog-based procurement process through
which it can drive compliance with them.

In doing so, PTT Chemical has realized the following business benefits:
* A more than 50 percent reduction in purchase request to purchase
  order cycle time
* Significant cost reduction in cost per transaction
* Improved process standardization and contract compliance


"Through Ariba's technology, we are able to drive more spend through a
best practice sourcing process, reach more vendors and create more
competition," Khun Wilawan said. The company also has greater visibility
into its spend and contracts across categories, which Khun Wilawan says
allows it to identify opportunities for savings and adjust its
procurement strategy as necessary to drive them to the bottom line.

"By implementing Ariba solutions, PTT Chemical is working towards its
objectives of standardizing procurement practices and bringing more spend
under management," said Sudhir Grover, Regional Group Director, Southeast
Asia, Ariba.
