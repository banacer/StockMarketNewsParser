Sep 06, 2011 (SmarTrend(R) News Watch via COMTEX) -- Below are the top
five companies in the Mortgage REITs industry as measured by their Debt
to EBITDA ratio.

The measure of a debt's pay-back period is Debt/EBITDA. The longer the
payback period, the greater the risk. This metric ignores all tax
expenses even though a good portion are cash payments and gets paid first.

Two Harbors Investment Corp (AMEX:TWO - Snapshot Report) has a
Debt/EBITDA ratio of 58.96x based on total debt of $4.8 billion.

Capstead Mortgage (NYSE:CMO - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio of
55.06x based on total debt of $10.5 billion.

American Capital Agency (NASDAQ:AGNC - Analyst Report) has a Debt/EBITDA
ratio of 53.68x based on total debt of $35 billion.

Hatteras Financial (NYSE:HTS - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio
of 38.27x based on total debt of $14.8 billion.

Invesco Mortgage Capital (NYSE:IVR - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA
ratio of 37.31x based on total debt of $9.6 billion.

SmarTrend currently has shares of Invesco Mortgage Capital in an
Downtrend and issued the Downtrend alert on June 15, 2011 at $21.14. The
stock has fallen 22.3% since the Downtrend alert was issued.
