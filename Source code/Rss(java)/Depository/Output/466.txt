Charter Signs Sam Bradford to Quarterback New 'Hometown Superstar' Ads



Charter extends and expands Rams sponsorship
















ST. LOUIS, Sept. 6, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Charter
Communications, Inc. has chosen St. Louis Rams' quarterback Sam Bradford
to star in its latest advertising campaign. Charter is the first large
St. Louis company Mr. Bradford has contracted with to serve as
spokesperson.







Charter also recently inked an expanded sponsorship agreement with the
St. Louis Rams. "There are significant similarities among our two
organizations," said Michael Lovett, Charter President and CEO. "Both
organizations are dedicated to delivering excellence in our home town of
St. Louis and beyond. We're well positioned to take great strides this
year as well, building on improvements already noted by our fans and
customers across the nation."

Given the long-standing relationship between Charter and the Rams,
second-year quarterback Bradford was a natural fit for Charter's
"Hometown Superstar" campaign. Bradford along with other Charter
customers and employees will be featured in the campaign, which kicks off
September 6 on cable and broadcast networks, in print ads, online and via
outdoor media.

"Sam's dedication, work ethic and leadership are inspiring, and we're
thrilled to have a Rams standout - and Charter customer - support this
effort," said Allan Samson, Senior Vice President, Marketing for Charter.
"Sam's ability to stay focused during challenging times both on and off
the field and the respect he shows passionate St. Louis fans are
admirable. That kind of energy and dedication is what motivates the
Charter team as well."

According to Bradford, starring in a Charter commercial was a new role
for him, with a producer calling the plays. "It's something I couldn't
have done if I didn't really enjoy my own experience as a Charter
customer," he said.

It's a new and promising season for Sam Bradford and for Charter; both
with talented teams. For Charter, "working hard to be St. Louis's next
hometown superstar" means putting customers first, offering new and
enhanced products, winning new fans and pleasing longtime supporters. And
for Sam Bradford it means rising to the top. "I go into every game
expecting us to win," Bradford said.

Rams' press conferences, interviews, studio shows and more will be
conducted in the newly renamed Charter Studio at Rams Park in Earth City.
Charter will also carry additional Rams-related programming On Demand,
including player profiles, fan favorite, cheerleader footage, 87 area
high school games of the week, and much more original content.

"Working as a company and as individuals, Charter has lent its support to
the St. Louis area and to the Rams," said Bob Reif, Chief Marketing
Officer of the Rams. "We look forward to continuing our strong
partnership with a hometown company that is innovative in its field and
quick to meet challenges. We appreciate Charter's commitment to St. Louis
and to the Rams as we continue to build our brand both locally and
nationally."

Earlier this month, Charter and NFL Network announced a new, long-term
agreement for carriage of NFL Network. Charter, among the largest cable
and Internet service providers in the country, will also offer customers
the innovative NFL RedZone channel. NFL Network and NFL RedZone are
available in high definition on Charter channels 710 and 711.
