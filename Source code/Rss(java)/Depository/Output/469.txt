Chelsea Therapeutics receives new US patent for Droxidopa drug

10:41 am by Brad Lemaire


Chelsea Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CHTP) said on Tuesday that the U.S. Patent
Office has issued a new patent for the use of drug Droxidopa to treat
fibromyalgia, a chronic disorder characterized by widespread muscle pain,
joint stiffness, and fatigue.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based drug maker said the claims of the
patent are related to methods of reducing pain linked to fibromyalgia by
administering droxidopa alone, or in combination with other medications.

Recently, Chelsea finished signing up 120 patients for its phase two
trial of droxidopa for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Top-line results of
the clinical trial are due by the end of the year, the company said.

The cause of fibromyalgia is still unknown, but research has focused on
the role of norepinephrine (NE) reuptake and availability in the central
nervous system. NE is a hormone and neurotransmitter that has been linked
to chronic pain and depression.

Droxidopa, which is taken orally, is converted by the body into
norepinephrine, resulting in increased levels of the hormone in the
nervous system.

Additionally, the drug is in phase three trials to treat neurogenic
orthostatic hypotension (NOH) in patients with Parkinson’s disease.  NOH
results from a deficient release of norepinephrine, used by autonomic
nerves to send signals to the blood vessels and the heart. It is
characterized by lightheadedness, dizziness and blurred vision.

Adding to its pipeline, the company’s two late-stage candidates, CH-1504
and CH-4051, are being developed for autoimmune disorders and diseases
which include rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease
and cancer.
