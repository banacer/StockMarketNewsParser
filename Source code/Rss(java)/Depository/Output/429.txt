With a dividend yield of more than 14%, it is hard not to be interested
in Annaly Capital (NLY), the largest mortgage REIT. The last five
headlines of Seeking Alpha articles about the company--all
positive--demonstrate that it is a popular stock among buy side analysts
and contributors to Seeking Alpha.

Annaly Yield vs. the S&P 500
The S&P 500 (SPY) has a dividend yield of a little over 2%, meaning
Annaly's dividend is more than 600% higher. What is the catch with
Annaly's huge dividend? What could go wrong? This article, and the next
one in the series, which is forthcoming, aim to examine that question by
taking a look at the company's financial statements and figuring out how
Annaly makes money.

The article refers to the company's latest quarterly filing with the SEC,
available here (pdf). As with some of my other articles, we are looking
at the big picture so numbers may be rounded more than would be
appropriate in a thorough analysis, to simplify the math.

Fair Warning & Disclosure: The author is a real estate investor, not a
trained stock market analyst. The analysis in this article was done based
strictly on the financial statements without any external support from
the company and without referring to any sell-side analyst coverage of
the company. I am interested in Annaly because I manage a portfolio of
real estate loans...a miniature version of a mortgage REIT, but with
virtually no leverage. This perspective may allow me to analyze Annaly a
little differently than the average analyst, hopefully providing a
different perspective on its business than the usual one.

Annaly's Balance Sheet
Annaly lists assets of $101 billion, including $97 billion of "Agency
Mortgage Backed Securities." These are bonds issued by Fannie Mae
(FNMA.OB), Freddie Mac (FMCC.OB), and Ginnie Mae, mostly backed by home
loans. Fannie and Freddie are government owned today (and losing a lot of
money). There is a stong likelihood the government will keep pumping
money into the agencies before they would let owners of Fannie and
Freddie bonds take any losses.

Note: "Strong likelihood" is not the same as an absolute guarantee. Hence
the difference in yield between Agency bonds of Fannie and Freddie, vs.
treasury bonds with the same maturity.

On the liability side, Annaly shows $78 billion of "Repurchase
Agreements"--loans to Annaly secured by the agency bonds that it owns.
Another $5 billion is listed as "Payable for Investments Purchased."
Together, these two items total $83 billion. So of $97 billion of bonds
held, Annaly is borrowing about 86% of the money and has actually put up
cash for something like the other 14% (actually, a little less, since
there are some other liabilities that we are ignoring in this analysis).

Let's pause here to calculate one more thing, which will become important
later. If we look at the ratio of Annaly's debt to equity, we get
86%/14%=about 6 times.

Annaly's Income Statement
Annaly received interest on its portfolio of Agency bonds in the latest
quarter of about $950 million. Annualizing that number, we can estimate
interest income of $3.8 billion. Comparing the interst income of $3.8
billion and the balance sheet entry of $97 billion of such bonds, we can
estimate Annaly is earning about 3.9% on its portfolio of bonds. Page 11
of the quarterly report of Annaly shows how the Company is earning this
yield--about a quarter of the agency bonds owned have a maturity of more
than five years, while the lion's share of the balance is securities with
a maturity of 1-5 years.

Meanwhile interest expense on the loans to purchase most of those bonds
was about $100 million. Annualizing this number, we get $400 billion.
Comparing this expense with the principal amount of Annaly's loans of $83
billion, we can see the effective borrowing costs is about 0.5%-a very
low borrowing cost. Page 13 of the annual report states that the weighted
average maturity of these loans to Annaly is 130 days.

Tying it All Together
Annaly earns a 3.9% interest rate on its investments, and borrows money
at an effective rate of 0.5% (on the borrowings secured by those
investments). The "spread" between these two numbers is 3.4%.

As we calculated previously, Annaly has leverage of about 6 times.
Therefore, this "spread" is magnified by a factor of about 6, resulting
in a return on equity (before operating expenses) of something like 3.4%
x 6 = about 20%. Let's call this number the "cash-on-cash return" after
accounting for leverage, but before accounting for operating expenses.

Of course, Annaly does have operating expenses. General and
administrative expenses were $57 million in the latest quarter, or about
$228 million on an annualized basis. The top two officers of the company
each earned about $24 million last year, and the CFO earned another $9
million or so. Annaly also appears to spend some money on hedging various
risks in its portfolio, which is presumably one of its larger expenses.

When various expenses are taken out, Annaly can afford to pay
shareholders a 14+% dividend. So, if annaly were a fund rather than a
public company, the operating costs and management fees would eat up
about 6% of the maximum possible return of 20%, which is the approximate
return that investors would receive if operating costs and management
fees were zero, and all the cash flow were paid out to investors.

In the next article, we will examine the risks facing investors in Annaly
Capital, referring back to the underlying analysis in this article.

Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to
initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
