ARIAD Announces Appointment of Senior Pharmaceutical Executive to Lead
Global Commercial Operations




















CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sep 06, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- ARIAD Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. today announced the appointment of Martin J. Duvall to the position
of senior vice president, commercial operations, reporting to the chief
executive officer. Mr. Duvall will be responsible for leading the global
commercialization of ARIAD's innovative oncology drug candidates,
including its investigational pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor, ponatinib, which is
in a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with resistant or
intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia-chromosome positive
acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Mr. Duvall has more than 25 years of experience in the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries, with a focus on oncology sales, marketing,
commercial development, commercial strategy and general management. He
joins ARIAD from Merck and Company, where he served as senior vice
president and general manager of Merck's global oncology franchise since
2010.







Prior to Merck, Mr. Duvall led global marketing and commercial operations
at Abraxis Bioscience, Inc., where he was responsible for the worldwide
commercial strategy for Abraxis' lead product, Abraxane(R) and for
running the company's commercial and medical business units in China,
Canada and Europe. Before that, he led commercial operations, development
and strategy for MGI Pharma, Inc., where he and his colleagues built the
business organization that supported the successful launch and
commercialization of MGI's flagship product, Aloxi(R).

Earlier in his career, he held numerous oncology marketing and sales
roles at Sanofi-Aventis and its predecessor companies. While at Aventis,
prior to joining MGI, he led global development, commercialization and
strategic direction of Aventis' cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, including
Taxotere(R).

"Marty has demonstrated unequivocal success in both U.S. and
international oncology leadership roles, working in both large
pharmaceutical and mid-sized biotechnology companies on drugs to treat
both solid tumors and hematological cancers," stated Harvey J. Berger,
M.D., chairman and chief executive officer of ARIAD. "He has the global
experience, leadership skills and dedication that we need to maximize the
value of ponatinib and our pipeline of oncology drug candidates for our
shareholders and the entrepreneurial know-how needed to build a
'second-to-none' commercial organization."

"His experience leading the global strategy and operations for major
oncology products, such as Abraxane(R), Dacogen(R), Aloxi(R) and
Taxotere(R), across multiple cancer indications will be highly valuable
as we prepare for the potential global launch of ponatinib beginning in
late 2012 or early 2013, and for commercialization of our other product
candidates like AP26113 that we expect will follow thereafter," he added.

Mr. Duvall holds a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry from Muhlenberg
College, a Master's degree in Chemistry from The Johns Hopkins University
and a Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of
Kansas.

About ARIAD

ARIAD's vision is to transform the lives of cancer patients with
breakthrough medicines. The Company's mission is to discover, develop and

current therapies are inadequate. ARIAD's product candidate,
ridaforolimus, is an investigational mTOR inhibitor being developed by
Merck that has successfully completed a Phase 3 clinical trial in
patients with soft-tissue and bone sarcomas and is being studied in
multiple cancer indications. ARIAD's second internally discovered product
candidate, ponatinib, is an investigational pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor in a
pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia
and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. For additional information, please
