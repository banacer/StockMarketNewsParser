Brazil Carmakers May Lose Some Planned Tax Breaks, Estado Says


By Matthew Bristow - Tue Sep 06 13:22:28 GMT 2011









Brazil√¢¬Ä¬ôs government may withdraw planned tax breaks for some
carmakers over non-compliance with directives on energy efficiency and
use of locally made parts, O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper reported, citing
a federal government official it didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt identify.

The tax cuts were part of the government√¢¬Ä¬ôs industrial policy known
as √¢¬Ä¬úBrasil Maior,√¢¬Ä¬ù or Greater Brazil, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper said.
