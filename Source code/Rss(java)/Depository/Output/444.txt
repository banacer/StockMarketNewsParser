The U.S. Army has ordered an armed, unmanned aerial vehicle produced by
AeroVironment Inc. that can be carried in a backpack and which transmits
live color video.

The contract for the âSwitchbladeâ air vehicle is for more than
$49 million. The aircraft launches from a small tube and is controlled on
AeroVironmentâs standard small unmanned aircraft system ground
control unit. In addition, upon confirming the target using the live
video feed, the operator then sends a command to the air vehicle to arm
it and lock its trajectory onto the target.



Flying quietly at high speed, the Switchblade can deliver an onboard
explosive payload with precision while minimizing collateral damage,
according to AeroVironment. With the ability to call off a strike even
after the air vehicle is armed, Switchblade provides a level of control
not available in other weapon systems, the company said.
