Black Box Network Services Recognized by Cisco for Excellence in Customer

PITTSBURGH, Sep 06, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Black Box Corporation , a
leading communications system integrator dedicated to designing,
sourcing, implementing and maintaining today's complete communications
solutions, announced today that it has achieved a Customer Satisfaction
Excellence Gold Star from Cisco. This designation recognizes Black Box
Network Services for delivering outstanding customer service to customers
in the United States.

"Black Box puts tremendous focus on servicing our customers and making
sure they receive the best support possible. We are honored to be
recognized by Cisco for our success in customer satisfaction," stated
Peter Marquis, Vice President, Black Box Network Services. Black Box has
received this award for three consecutive years.

Black Box maintains a Gold partnership status with Cisco and delivers
many Cisco solutions including Cisco unified communications and business
video, route/switch, wireless and security. Black Box offers a full
portfolio of life-cycle services including comprehensive Day 2 support
through its innovative ConvergenceCare(R) service bundles which bring
together maintenance and advanced offerings such as real-time network
performance monitoring and access to Black Box's Network Operations
Center for 24/7/365 support. "Delivering this type of end-to-end solution
helps our customers get the most out of their Cisco solutions," Marquis
continued.

"Customer service is a cornerstone of the Cisco Resale Channel Program.
We are pleased to recognize and congratulate Black Box for achieving
outstanding customer satisfaction," said Edison Peres, Senior Vice
President of the worldwide channels go-to-market group at Cisco.

Cisco measures the customer satisfaction levels achieved by its Gold,
Silver, and Premier Certified partners based on regional target goals,
providing a weighted-average of a partner's pre- and post-sales support
over a rolling 12-month period. Partners that achieve outstanding
customer satisfaction are awarded the Customer Satisfaction Excellence
Gold Star and can be found using the advanced search menu in the Cisco
Partner Locator.

The Cisco Resale Channel Program provides a framework for partners to
build the sales, technical and Cisco Lifecycle Services skills required
to deliver Cisco solutions to end customers. Through the program's
specializations and certifications, Cisco recognizes a partner's
expertise in deploying solutions based on Cisco advanced technologies and
services. Using a third-party audit process, the program validates
partner qualifications such as technology skills, business best
practices, customer satisfaction and pre-sale and post-sale support
capabilities - critical factors in choosing a trusted partner.
