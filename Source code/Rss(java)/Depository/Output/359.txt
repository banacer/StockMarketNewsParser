Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) closed Friday's downbeat trading session at
$26.38. In the past year, the stock has hit a 52-week low of $22.99 and
52-week high of $46.15. Autodesk (ADSK) stock has been showing support
around $25.57 and resistance in the $27.29 range. Technical indicators
for the stock are Bearish and S&P gives Autodesk (ADSK) a neutral 3 STARS
(out of 5) hold rating. For a hedged play on Autodesk (ADSK), look at the
Apr '12 $26.00 covered call for a net debit in the $22.33 area. That is
also the break-even stock price for this trade. This covered call has a
duration of 228 days, provides 15.35% downside protection and an assigned
return rate of 16.44% for an annualized return rate of 26.31% (for
comparison purposes only). A lower-cost hedged play for Autodesk (ADSK)
would use a longer term call option in place of the covered call stock
purchase. To use this strategy look at going long the Autodesk (ADSK) Jan
'13 $15.00 call and selling the Apr '12 $26.00 call for a total debit of
$9.00. The trade has a lifespan of 228 days and would provide 9.02%
downside protection and an assigned return rate of 22.22% for an
annualized return rate of 35.58% (for comparison purposes only). Autodesk
(ADSK) has a current trailing average dividend yield of 0%. [ABR-Seven
