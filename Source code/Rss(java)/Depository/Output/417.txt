Blackboard Upgrades Integration for Blackboard Learn and Blackboard
Collaborate



Seamless Integration Brings Robust Collaboration to the Learning Platform
















WASHINGTON, Sept. 6, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Blackboard Inc.
today announced an upgraded integration for Blackboard Collaborate(TM)
and Blackboard Learn(TM) 9.1 which significantly enhances the performance
of the company's Web, video and voice conferencing platform within the
latest release of its flagship learning management system. The
integration enables users to create and experience virtual classes
directly in their Blackboard Learn course.

With the integration, students, instructors and administrators can access
all aspects of online learning - including virtual classes - within the
same workflow, which can lead to greater adoption and a more dynamic
learning experience. Students have access to live virtual sessions and
recordings with a single click, and greater opportunity to interact in
real time in social learning opportunities with peers and instructors.
Teachers and administrators can save time by eliminating the need for
multi-system training and streamlining administrative tasks.

"The new Blackboard Collaborate integrated with Blackboard Learn
represents a significant leap forward for our user community, as it
provides an improved interface and seamless access to all learning from a
single, combined platform," says Tova Duby, senior manager for eLearning
Platform Operations at Babson College. "The streamlined administrative
workflows save our educators time, enabling them to focus on teaching and
learning, while our students benefit from live, dynamic interaction in
our online learning programs."

The integration gives greater control to instructors and administrators
who can leverage the new interface to create live sessions in one click
and configure settings to create a customized experience. Advanced
administrative settings enable instructors to schedule multiple live
sessions per course, set up sessions with telephony and Webcam options,
pre-load virtual class content and designate moderators and outside
guests.

The fully-supported, Blackboard Collaborate(TM) Web Conferencing Building
Block 3.0 for Blackboard Learn 9.1 joins a number of existing
integrations available for earlier versions of Blackboard Learn.

"Blending the design principles of the Blackboard Learn platform with the
user experience of the Blackboard Collaborate platform supports
administrators by minimizing support and training costs," said Maurice
Heiblum, president of Blackboard Collaborate. "We are excited to provide
a solution that not only enhances the user experience, but also gives
institutions a greater return on their technology investments."

In addition to the enhanced integration with Blackboard Learn, Blackboard
Collaborate supports integrations with a wide range of learning
management systems including Blackboard Learn ANGEL EditionÃ‚Â®,
WebCTÃ‚Â®, Sakai, Moodle, Desire2Learn(TM), Pearson LearningStudio(TM)
and Fronter(TM). The Blackboard Collaborate platform also includes an
open Application Programming Interface (API) to support custom
integrations and enhancements.
