With alternative energy stocks such asÃ‚Â JA Solar Holdings (NASDAQ:
JASO), Yingli Green Energy Holdings (NYSE: YGE), AMYRIS (NASDAQ: AMRS)
and Sun Power (NASDAQ: SPWRA) falling, investors should look to
GreenCell, Inc (OTC: GCLL) as an investmentÃ‚Â vehicle to ride the gains
that will eventually zoom back into the sector.Ã‚Â  GreenCell Inc, a
nanotech company involved in materials research and
development,Ã‚Â offers a unique play on both the alternative energy and
the ceramics sectors, well over $70 billion combined, from a position
that is protected from the current downturn yet well situated to profit
from the size of the overall composite market.

Solar power, biofuels, and windÃ‚Â energy stocksÃ‚Â are all collapsing
from the weight of too much, too soon with too little market demand.Ã‚Â 
Articles in major publications have focused on this in recent
editions.Ã‚Â  The August 31, 2011 edition of The Wall Street Journal
carried the article, "For Solar, No Guarantees" on page B3.Ã‚Â  "Solar
power peers out of the gloom," blared the headlines for an article in the
Financial Times.Ã‚Â  An article in the August 2011 issue of Scientific
American concludes, in brief, that "Despite extensive research, biofuels
are still not commercially competitive.Ã‚Â  The breakthroughs needed,
revealed by recent science, may be tougher to realize than previously
thought."

Investors in solar power, wind energy and biofuel companies are realizing
this expensive lesson that the Fifth Estate is broadcasting.Ã‚Â 
Evergreer Solar Inc recently filed for bankruptcy.Ã‚Â  Solyndra Inc has
had to close facilities and initiate widepread layoffs.Ã‚Â  This summer
has been an especially cruel season for solar power stocks (how
ironic).Ã‚Â  According to Sun Power (NASDAQ: SPWRA) CEO Tom Werner, who
observed recentlyÃ‚Â in his company's guidance statement for future
earnings: the problems of the solar energy sector are structural in
nature.Ã‚Â  This is the classic definition of an asset bubble that is
bursting.Ã‚Â  This was analyzed in a recent article in
www.smallcapnetwork.com.Ã‚Â 

These hard times are reflected in stock prices across the alternative
energy sector.Ã‚Â  Amyris, a biofuel company, is trading under $19 a
share, more than 44% below its year high.Ã‚Â  Wall Street is not keen on
the future for
Amyris as there is a 7.49% short float.Ã‚Â  JA Solar Holdings is at
$3.34, down from a year high of $10.24.Ã‚Â  With a short float of 9.59%,
many are saying this is not a good place for retirement funds or college
savings unless going short on the stock.Ã‚Â  At $5.60, Yingli Green
Energy Holdings is down from a year high of $14.29.Ã‚Â  While the stock
price for Yingli is low, at 13.95% the short float most certainlyÃ‚Â is
not.Ã‚Â 

What investors should be able to now recognize in the growth potential
for GreenCell, Inc is that iit allows for exposure to the alternative
sector without falling prey to the intense competition and
overdevelopment at this stage.Ã‚Â  In a recent article about GreenCell,
it was pointed out to investors that, "GreenCell is involved in a joint
venture with SenCer Inc. to develop, commercialize and market SenCer's
UltraTemp(TM) ceramic composite materials that has both home and
transportation applications. Late last week, GreenCell announced that
they have demonstrated a new process for ceramic igniters plus the
company had successfully produced a 12 and 24 volt igniter. In addition,
GreenCell noted that they have developed a new anode material for both
automotive sensors and UltraTemp-C based fuel cells."

This is where savvy investors want to be: not mining for the gold, but
selling the shovels.Ã‚Â  AnytimeÃ‚Â a commodity, such as fuel cells or
solar panels, is created, the price will always be beaten down by free
market forces.Ã‚Â  As an example, the price of crystalline silicon
modules for solar energy has plunged from $3.58 per watt of generation in
2008 to only $1.43 at present, according to a recent article in the
Financial Times.Ã‚Â  A recent article on www.smallcapnetwork.com pointed
out how sport market prices for solar cells and wafers have collapsed by
40% in 2011.Ã‚Â  As noted by Andrew Beebe, Chief Commercial Officer of
Suntech, one of the largest panel makers in the world, "We've seen
incredible, unbridled growth for about a decade, and over the next year
that is gong to change.Ã‚Â  Over the next few quarters there will be more
supply than demand."

Despite the oversupply in the market, alternative energy stocks will
recover.Ã‚Â  A recent Goldman Sachs report stated that solar power would
be rebounding (stock prices do not reflect that, yet, though).Ã‚Â  This
was the subject of a recent article in www.smallcapnetwork.com.Ã‚Â  When
this does inevitably happens, investors in GreenCell will profit from the
recovery.Ã‚Â  GreenCell is not just exposure to alternative energy,
though: the ceramics market is huge, estimated by one report to be
"...worth $10 billion per year and growing rapidly."

This overcapacity in solar power and other forms of alternative energy
plays to the strength of GreenCell.Ã‚Â  By developing a new anode
material for fuel cells, GreenCell is establishing itself as the house,
not the player.Ã‚Â  And it is the house that always wins.
