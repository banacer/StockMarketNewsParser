Sep 06, 2011 (SmarTrend(R) News Watch via COMTEX) -- Below are the top
five companies in the Construction & Farm Machinery industry as measured
by their Debt to EBITDA ratio.

The measure of a debt's pay-back period is Debt/EBITDA. The longer the
payback period, the greater the risk. This metric ignores all tax
expenses even though a good portion are cash payments and gets paid first.

American Railcar Industries (NASDAQ:ARII - Snapshot Report) has a
Debt/EBITDA ratio of 13.14x based on total debt of $275 million.

Terex (NYSE:TEX - Analyst Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio of 12.93x based
on total debt of $1.4 billion.

Federal Signal (NYSE:FSS - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio of
7.67x based on total debt of $233.9 million.

CNH Global (NYSE:CNH - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio of 7.14x
based on total debt of $16.5 billion.

Manitowoc (NYSE:MTW - Analyst Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio of 6.32x
based on total debt of $2.1 billion.
