Sep 06, 2011 (SmarTrend(R) News Watch via COMTEX) -- Below are the top
five companies in the Specialized Finance industry as measured by their
Debt to EBITDA ratio.

The measure of a debt's pay-back period is Debt/EBITDA. The longer the
payback period, the greater the risk. This metric ignores all tax
expenses even though a good portion are cash payments and gets paid first.

NewStar Financial (NASDAQ:NEWS - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio
of 21.93x based on total debt of $1.3 billion.

KKR Financial Holdings (NYSE:KFN - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA
ratio of 14.22x based on total debt of $6.7 billion.

Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR - Analyst Report) has a Debt/EBITDA
ratio of 10.76x based on total debt of $7.2 billion.

Asset Acceptance Capital (NASDAQ:AACC - Snapshot Report) has a
Debt/EBITDA ratio of 10.69x based on total debt of $171.3 million.

PHH (NYSE:PHH - Snapshot Report) has a Debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.43x based
on total debt of $5.7 billion.

SmarTrend currently has shares of Interactive Brokers in an Downtrend and
issued the Downtrend alert on June 08, 2011 at $15.98. The stock has
fallen 9.9% since the Downtrend alert was issued.
