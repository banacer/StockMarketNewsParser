American Animal Hospital Association and Heska Corporation Announce New
Online Continuing Education Series














LOVELAND, Colo., Sept. 6, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- The American
Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) and Heska Corporation are
collaborating on a new series for online continuing education. Using the
complexities and challenges of real-life examples, the "Solve It! Series"
combines engaging content in a case study format and adds an element of
mystery. Designed by a panel of experts, AAHA and Heska believe this
interactive learning series can improve pet health care by advancing the
diagnostic skills of the entire team.

"Our team at AAHA is excited to be working with our HESKA colleagues to
produce such a novel approach to learning," says Dr. Michael Cavanaugh,
AAHA Executive Director. "The 'Solve It! Series' is designed to bring the
practice team together to investigate and solve interesting and
challenging cases. It will be fun to be part of the cases as we
accumulate information and answer questions week to week so the
veterinary sleuths on your practice team work together to efficiently
diagnose and solve the case!"

Playing the role of "Vet Investigators," practice team members
participate in competitive team challenges. Points are earned as they
crack patient cases and solve some of the most interesting mysteries a
team can encounter in daily practice. The first case in the Solve It!
Series, "The Case of the Limping Poodle," will be introduced in October
2011. New cases will follow every month, culminating in a series overview
at the AAHA 2012 Conference.

Putting their well-earned knowledge into practice, teams who register for
the Solve It! Series will accumulate points for both participation and
accuracy. The team with the highest points total will receive new
state-of-the-art diagnostic laboratory analyzers from Heska.

"We welcome the opportunity to partner with an elite organization such as
AAHA to create healthier outcomes for customers and their clients," says
Michael McGinley, President and COO of Heska Corporation. "We expect this
new learning program to add a great deal of value to the educational
offerings in our industry."
