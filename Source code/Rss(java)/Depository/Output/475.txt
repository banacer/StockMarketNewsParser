Crown Media Family Networks (CMFN), a division of parent company Crown
Media Holdings Inc. and home of Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movie
Channel, has named Alexandra Smith and Ayn Prince as directors of
programming for Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movie Channel,
respectively. Smith and Prince are both located in Studio City, CA and
will report into Darren Melameth, vice president of programming, planning
and scheduling.

√¢¬Ä¬úAlexandra and Ayn come to Crown Media with extensive backgrounds in
research and program planning with robust knowledge of the industry
marketplace,√¢¬Ä¬ù said Melameth. √¢¬Ä¬úThey will play instrumental roles
in the execution of all aspects of strategy and scheduling for the
networks and will work in tandem to enhance programming and brand
initiatives across both networks .√¢¬Ä¬ù

As director of programming for Hallmark Channel, Smith will be
responsible for managing the day-to-day process of implementing original
movies and series to on-air. She will oversee the scheduling database
(SIMS) and work closely with department heads of programming, original
movie development, and scheduling and acquisitions, in order to
effectively develop and execute the network√¢¬Ä¬ôs goals.

Previously, Smith was the manager of international program planning and
acquisitions at NBCUniversal, Inc. √¢¬Ä¬ì where she formulated long-range
schedule strategies across multiple international territories for E! &
Style. She has also held positions at Tangerine Global; the Tennis
Channel; Lief, Cabraser, Heimann & Berstein, LLP; and Irell & Manella,
LLP. Smith earned a bachelor of arts degree at the University of
California √¢¬Ä¬ì Santa Cruz.

In Prince√¢¬Ä¬ôs role as director of programming for Hallmark Movie
Channel, she will be charged with overseeing the monthly program
schedules and highlights for the network √¢¬Ä¬ì which includes stunt and
event planning, and working closely with Smith to tactically maximize
program inventory. She will also be responsible for capitalizing on
marketplace trends and conditions to create an optimal on-air schedule
for viewers.

Prior to joining CMFN, Prince was the manager of research for Disney
Channels Worldwide. At Disney, she played a key role in scheduling
decisions with her daily market analysis of Disney√¢¬Ä¬ôs programming
against competitors. In addition, Prince oversaw research projects for
short-term and long-term strategy which included series performance
trending, competitive programming trends and cultural events. In her 10
years in the industry, Prince has held positions at SOAPnet, ABC Family,
ABC Daytime, Sony Pictures Television, NC, United Paramount Network and
Paramount Pictures Studios. She holds a degree in Electronic Media
Management from the California State University √¢¬Ä¬ì Northridge.
