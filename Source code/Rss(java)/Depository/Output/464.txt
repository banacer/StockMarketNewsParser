NHL Alumni take to the ice for the CE Franklin 3-on-3 Challenge

NHL alumni will be hitting the ice for a great cause at the second annual
CE Franklin 3-on-3 Challenge, a hockey tournament in support of Calgary
Health Trust, on Saturday, September 10, 2011. Former Calgary Flames
forward Craig Conroy is the Celebrity Chair for this year's tournament.

"CE Franklin is a proud supporter of Calgary Health Trust and the
important work that they do," says President and Chief Executive Officer
Michael West. "We are very excited to once again host this family event
in support of Neonatal Intensive Care Units in Calgary."

Several NHL alumni, including former Calgary Flames Rene Corbet, Jeff
Shantz and Lindsey Carson, will take to the ice with players from the
community at the Don Hartman North East Sportsplex.

Family and friends are also invited to participate in this great day of
hockey, food and family fun. Admission is free. There will be a KidsZone
open from 11a.m. - 2 p.m., as well as a visit from 2010 Olympic gold
medalist Christine Nesbitt.

Tournament proceeds will enhance equipment in Neonatal Intensive Care
Units at the Foothills Medical Centre, Peter Lougheed Centre and
Rockyview General Hospital. These units provide specialized, high- level
care to sick and premature newborns, helping them survive the most
critical situations.

Approximately 10 per cent of the 20,000 babies born annually in Calgary
receive care in the NICUs. Patricia and Warren Nielsen experienced the
exceptional care the NICUs provide first-hand when their daughter,
Marilyn, was born two months early, weighing only three pounds.

"It was scary at first, but the staff in the NICUs helped settle us. It's
a really calm, supportive environment, and I can't say enough about the
people who work there," says Patricia. "It was the best place for Marilyn
to be and the staff really took care of us, too."

Last year's CE Franklin 3-on-3 Challenge raised $155,000 for NICUs in
Calgary. The money helped purchase a hybrid warmer and cardio respiratory
monitors for the units.
