Mr. Rule and his firm, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, also
represented another small Internet company filing a private antitrust
suit against Google: Tradecomet.com LLC. In July, a New York appeals
court rejected that company's appeal against a ruling dismissing its
case, saying it should have been filed in Google's home district in
California instead.

Google has long suspected that Microsoft was helping orchestrate these
small, private suits in an bid to get access to Google's internal
documents through legal discovery.

In March 2010, a Google spokesman told The Wall Street Journal, "It's
become clear that our competitors are scouring court dockets around the
world looking for complaints against Google into which they can inject
themselves, learn more about our business practices, and use that
information to develop a broader antitrust complaint against us."

Microsoft has repeatedly denied being behind the suits. TradeComet and
myTriggers also said their claims against Google were unconnected to
Microsoft.

It isn't clear if myTriggers will continue to press ahead with its case,
or whether TradeComet will file a new case in California.

In a statement, myTriggers said it was reviewing the decision and
considering its next steps. A Google spokesman declined to comment
Thursday on the myTriggers ruling.
